<p>What a year 2022 was! We had the DeFi/Celcius collapse, the BTC price dropping like a brick, and FTX as the biggest crypto exchange failure in history.</p>
<p>We continue to be very optimistic about the crypto sector future, and are confident that the additional scrutiny of our industry will lead to better regulations and a safer future for cryptocurrencies.</p>
