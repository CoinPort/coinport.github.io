# Easier International Funds Transfer Q2 2024

Great news for international customers. From April 2024 CoinPort will be able to offer International Payments - International funds transfer instruction (IFTI-E). ### bold  <img src="images/ifti.jpg" alt="IFTI" class="center" style="max-width: 280px; float: right; padding: 20px;"###

An IFTI-E is an **  ### italic  electronic funds transfer instruction (EFTI) ### ** that is sent to or received from another country.

What this means is that international payments for our customers will be cheaper, easier and faster than using the SWIFT system.
