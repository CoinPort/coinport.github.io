Approached Equitise, here is the response:


Hi Peter,

Thanks for your interest in **Equitise**. After reviewing the information you have provided we have decided not to proceed.

The primary reason is that Coin Harbour may not currently align with the investment strategies and areas of interest of investors on our platform.

At **Equitise**, we strive to ensure that all opportunities presented to investors on the platform have the best chance of a successful raise. We do this so that companies receive a meaningful return on the material cost and time commitment involved with raising capital.

We wish you all the best, and encourage you to reach out in the future.

Cheers,

Kevin
