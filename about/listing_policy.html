LISTING POLICY

With the mission to digitize and to create better transaction networks for the world whether it is for currency, asset, or anything of value, CoinPort  is proud to present its Digital Asset Framework.

The Framework is designed to set the standards for how we evaluate digital assets to be part of our listing and how we make decisions to keep our customers' best interests in mind.

We do not in any way endorse assets and we reserve the absolute right to list, not to list, and de-list any asset for trading regardless of how it met the standards specified in this framework. This framework is subject to change or improvements over time.

There are three main criteria we evaluate before listing approval which are

(1) A-Must Criteria

(2) Technical and Operational Feasibility

(3) Committee Scoring. On top of this, after listing, we still conduct an evaluation periodically.

CoinPort  Digital Asset Framework falls under the intellectual property of Coin Port Pty Ltd. The framework is not and should not be treated as legal and financial advice. The intent and sole purpose of the framework is to give general information. It should be treated as "as is" without any representation or warranty, whether express, implied, or statutory. CoinPort  reserves the right to update this framework at any time.
