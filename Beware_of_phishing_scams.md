Beware of phishing scams
While phishing scams come in many forms, the most common scenario occurs when a client uses a search engine to search the word ‚ÄúCoinPort‚Äù, clicks on the first link they see and unknowingly enters their sign-in credentials into a fraudulent site imitating the real CoinPort website. These sites will often look almost identical to the official CoinPort site, with the most telling difference being that the website address is noticeably different from the official URL, which is https://www.CoinPort.com/sign-in.
Another method of phishing occurs when you receive an unsolicited email or text that asks you to click a link or sign-in to your account. This could be a scammer whom is impersonating CoinPort or another exchange or wallet provider. The links will lead to a website that looks almost identical to the actual exchange or wallet.
These links are malicious and will request that you enter your username and password or, in the case of a wallet, your 12 or 24 word seed phrase. Any information that you enter will be recorded, sent to the scammers and be used against you to gain access to your accounts and steal your cryptocurrency.
It is important to be very careful and practice good habits to avoid falling victim to these scams.
