Greetings, and welcome to the CoinPort cryptocurrency exchange.
My name is Leonie Green, and I am the Customer Success Manager at CoinPort.

Unfortunately, the cryptocurrency space attracts many scammers. Scammers are attracted to cryptocurrency because there is a lot of wealth here, and that wealth can often be transferred anonymously, internationally and instantly. 

Last year more than 200,000 cryptocurrency-related scams were detected worldwide. Don't become another victim.

At CoinPort we work hard to protect the interests and investments of our members. We have automated systems in place that try to detect scams. 
Our staff monitor industry news for details of different scams; and we also observe customer behaviour, watching for scams.

In the past we have taken action, such as blocking transfers, to protect our members from scams. If we suspect a CoinPort member is potentially a scam victim we disable their account and phone or email to discuss our concerns.

Prevention is the best cure against scammers and other bad actors, and prevention starts with YOU.
