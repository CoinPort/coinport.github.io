# CoinPort Digital Asset Purchase Agreement

This Agreement defines the rights and obligations of Coin Harbour Pty Ltd (the "Project," "we," "us") and the User ("you") when you purchase any digital asset ("Token") on the CoinPort exchange platform ("the Exchange").

By purchasing a Token on the Exchange, you confirm that you are fully familiar with and agree to the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement is accepted by you when you complete the purchase of a Token.

Your unconditional acceptance of this Agreement is confirmed by pressing the "Buy" or similar button and transferring cryptocurrency to purchase a Token on the Exchange.

**PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT PURCHASE TOKENS ON THE EXCHANGE.**

BY PURCHASING TOKENS, YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY IT. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO CHANGE, ADD, OR DELETE THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT AT ANY TIME FOR ANY REASON. YOU MUST Regularly CHECK THIS AGREEMENT FOR CHANGES. SUCH CHANGES SHALL COME INTO FORCE IMMEDIATELY UPON PUBLICATION ON OUR SITE. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BY USING OUR EXCHANGE AFTER CHANGES TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AGREE TO THE CHANGED TERMS.

OWNERSHIP OF TOKENS HAS NO CONSEQUENCE OF ANY RIGHTS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OTHER THAN THE RIGHTS THAT MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT SPECIFIC TOKEN, AS DETERMINED BY ITS ISSUER. IN PARTICULAR, YOU UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT THAT TOKENS PURCHASED ON THE EXCHANGE DO NOT AUTOMATICALLY REPRESENT AND/OR DO NOT RELATE TO ANY INVESTOR RIGHTS, SHARES, OR EQUITY INSTRUMENTS IN COIN HARBOUR PTY LTD.

THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT CONTAIN OR IMPLY THE GIVING OF INVESTMENT ADVICE OR RECOMMENDATIONS. COINPORT IS THE EXCHANGE PLATFORM AND IS NOT THE ISSUER OF MOST TOKENS TRADED ON IT.
