1. WHAT ARE COOKIES?

A cookie is a small text file which a website saves on your computer or mobile device whenever you visit the site. A cookie has the ability to be viewed as an identity card of an Internet user, which informs the site of the user's return.

Cookies can be "session" or "permanent".

Session cookies expire whenever you exit the web browser after a user's session ends.

Permanent cookies are those that are saved in your browser and may remember your settings, actions and preferences on the website or other sites through a specified expiration date, if they are not previously deleted. The majority of cookies gather cumulative data (for example, how users come to the site and use it), however, there are some cookies that may collect personal data.

They may be posted by Coin Hartbour - the website operator (first-party cookies), as well as by a third party for their individual purposes (e.g., for advertisements).
