A decision has been made to change the business name and internet domain from "Coin Harbour" to "Coin Port" from 1st May 2024.

The main reason for this is that there are two potential spellings of Harbour, i.e. "Harbour" and "Harbor". This has caused confusion in the past, and was identified as a problem as we expand past Australian borders.

Another advantage of the name change is that the internet domain name has been reduced by three characters. The internet domain name was quite long and this change makes accessing the website slightly more convenient.

No changes are required by members of the exchange, all user and trade data remains the same. User emails, passwords, and profile details are unchanged.

Both the www.coinharbour.com.au and www.coinport.com.au internet addresses will continue to work, and from 1st May 2024 all internet traffic will be redirected to the new Coin Port site.

Our Social Media sites will also be updated as Coin Port from 1st May 2024.

We appreciate your patience during this transition.
