## Risks of Trading and Holding Crypto or Digital Currencies

The trading or holding of coins, tokens, crypto, digital currency, or digital assets of the like (collectively 'Coins') involves significant risks and the losses can be substantial. You should carefully consider and assess whether trading or holding of Coins is suitable for you depending upon your financial circumstances and tolerance to risk.

Coins such as Bitcoin and Ether are unlike traditional currencies, goods or commodities in the market and are subject to exceptional risks. Unlike other traditional forms of currency, Coins are decentralised and are not backed by a central bank, government or legal entities and remains unregulated. As such, the value of Coins may swing depending upon the market, confidence of investors, competing currencies, regulatory announcements or changes, technical problems or any other factors.

Due to the significant risks of trading Coins as well as the impact of technology and the international market, CoinPort cannot warrant or guarantee that particular Coins will be available on our Platform and Services. CoinPort reserves the right to stop offering trades in relation to particular Coins on our Platform and Services. We will use our reasonable endeavours to notify you if we cease to support trading in particular Coins. If this is the case, you will not be able to convert Coins into AUD or any other currency, however you will be given the option to move the Coins to another user, platform or third party website.

CoinPort only supports mechanisms such as Metacoins, Alt-Coins, Forks, Sidechains, Colour Coins or any other Coins which supplement and interact with digital currency, if CoinPort explicitly specifies through our Platform. The Platform will participate in Forks, airdrops and any other similar mechanisms at CoinPort’s absolute discretion. CoinPort does not allow for users to send Coins off the CoinPort Platform in order to pay, fund or contribute to an Initial Coin Offering unless explicitly stated and will not be responsible for the Coins sent off the platform nor the coins or tokens expected to be received from the Initial Coin Offering. CoinPort may also support the payment of a dividend, at CoinPort’s absolute discretion and if explicitly stated.

CoinPort is not responsible or liable for any Coins once they are transferred from our Platform to another site, device, platform or user. Nor is CoinPort responsible or liable for any Coins not traded on our Platform that have been sent into our Platform or Coins that have been sent to an incorrect wallet address or a wallet address for a different Coin. It is important for you to take precautions when transferring and storing your Coins whether on our platform or through other sites, wallets or devices. We take no responsibility for misappropriation or theft of your Coins. You should familiarise yourself with the security measures available when using a wallet service or other device for storage. Always take a greater degree of care and precaution to secure your passwords when operating in a digital environment.

## Trading and Using Your CoinPort Account

CoinPort will use its best endeavours to ensure that it meets its deposit and withdrawal timeframes. From time-to-time factors outside of CoinPort’s control may lead to delays. You acknowledge that CoinPort is not responsible for any losses that occur due to delays in processing deposits or withdrawals.

By using CoinPort’s Platform and Services, you acknowledge that CoinPort is not responsible for any delays you may experience in sending and transferring Coins to and/or from CoinPort’s Platform to other platforms, websites, users or wallets. These delays may be due to issues beyond CoinPort’s control, including issues with third party websites and platforms, wallets, congestion of the blockchain and CoinPort moving Coins into a secure storage vault or platform.

In addition to buying, selling, converting and trading Coins, you are only permitted to send your Coins to another user, platform, website or to your personal wallet. Due to the evolving nature of the technology, any technical issues regarding the blockchain and use of the network are beyond CoinPort’s control and CoinPort reserves the right to cancel transactions you have initiated which are delayed beyond a reasonable time or lapse due to time delays. In such circumstances, you may need to execute the transaction again or at another time.

In the circumstance where you have received, acquired, or accumulated any funds or assets due to an error, glitch or loophole, CoinPort may take reasonable action, including but not limited to restricting access or deducting the funds from the account, to recover the funds or assets from your CoinPort account. We will notify you if such error has occurred and it is our right to recover the misappropriated funds or assets.

It is your responsibility to check your CoinPort account and monitor the movement of your Coins including any pending, lapsed or cancelled through your transaction history and to re-execute any transactions which fail.

All deposits and withdrawals made are subject to the limits displayed on our Platform and Services. This amount may change from time to time due to the blockchain as well as the user demand, market activity and the price of particular Coins.

All fiat deposits and withdrawals can only be made to and from a financial institution account held by the verified CoinPort account holder.

During periods of market volatility, high volume trades, fast movement and illiquidity in the market, the market rate in which you buy, sell or trade Coins may be different to the price indicated on our Platform and as such we will be unable to execute your order and will return the funds to your account. CoinPort is not liable for any price variation due to market volatility, market or technology disruptions, delays or any other matters that caused by things that are outside CoinPort’s control. CoinPort may reasonably decide not to execute a trade if the market rate significantly increases or decreases or in the event of a market disruption or other event which is outside its control and in such cases CoinPort may cancel your buy/sell order and return the funds into your CoinPort account. CoinPort will exercise reasonable care to notify you of these events and when you receive a notification you must check your account and any pending or cancelled transactions.

## Conversion Services and Fees

A conversion fee applies to all transactions where Coins are purchased, sold or traded.

By using the CoinPort Platform, you accept the conversion rate and acknowledge that we may adjust our conversion fees at any time. CoinPort will notify you of the conversion fees that apply to your transaction at the time of the transaction.

We may delay, suspend or cancel a conversion transaction if we believe the transaction may be subject to illegal activity, fraud, including but not limited to the activities outlined in clause 13.

We reserve the right to delay, suspend or cancel a trade or transaction if there are technical reasons that prevent us from completing the transaction, or if CoinPort is unable to execute the transaction. This may be subject to reliance on a third party supplier, where we have reasonable belief that the trade is subject to illegal activity or fraud, technical difficulties or subject to a law enforcement action.

## Termination

In particular, emails to or from us and information submitted to or accessed via this Platform may not be secure and you should use discretion in deciding what information you send to us via these means.

Emails to and from us may undergo email filtering and virus scanning, including by third party contractors. We do not warrant that such filters and scans will be effective in removing viruses or other potentially harmful code.

You acknowledge that you use the Platform and Services (and obtain and transmit data to it) entirely at your own risk, that it is provided on an “as is” basis and that we do not make any representations or warranties as to the security, availability of our Platform and Services or that your access or use will be uninterrupted, timely or secure.

CoinPort securely stores Coin private keys and other information in order to maintain the security and integrity of the system. We are committed to protecting users’ Coins and other information we collect from you and hold in highly secure data centres operated by a third party. The datacentres used have ISO 270014, 270175 and 270186 certifications and PCI DSS7 compliance. This has been independently audited by third parties. ISO 27018 certification has also been achieved for our data centre partners, which demonstrates a system of controls in place that specifically address the privacy protection of customer content. We ensure that your information is safe by managing access controls, such as identity, access management, permissions and security credentials. Access to personal information is only granted to an employee of CoinPort to carry out duties required to support our customers. Strong, multi-factor authentication is used and access is revoked when no longer required.

CoinPort uses a two-factor authentication process in order to verify your identity, maintain security and prevent any fraud.

As part of CoinPort’s commitment to protecting your Coins, all significant financial and trading transactions made by you from the CoinPort Platform to another third party website, platform or user, as well as all AUD withdrawals from the Platform to your personal bank account, may be required to be performed using CoinPort’s two-factor authentication. CoinPort users may be required to implement and use two-factor authentication for all withdrawals and transactions to buy, sell and trade Coins. It is your responsibility to implement such measures, programs and applications onto your computer and/or phone, such as Google authenticator, and how to use these security measures in order to complete the transaction.

As part of operating our Platform and Services, CoinPort may hold your funds, assets or Coins on different exchange platforms.
