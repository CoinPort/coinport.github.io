# CoinPort Fees

CoinPort does not charge commissions or trading fees for crypto orders executed on the CoinPort exchange platform.

We aim to keep pricing simple and transparent. The price you see is the price you receive at execution.

CoinPort does not charge fees for AUD deposits or withdrawals made via the New Payments Platform (NPP).

Standard blockchain network fees may apply to cryptocurrency deposits and withdrawals. These fees are set by the underlying blockchain networks, not CoinPort, and may vary depending on network conditions. For example, transaction fees on the Ethereum network have previously exceeded AUD $30 during periods of congestion.
