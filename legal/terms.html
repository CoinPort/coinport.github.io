  <h1>CoinPort Terms and Conditions</h1>
  <h2>The Platform</h2>
  <p>The website CoinPort, and mobile applications, (collectively 'Platform') is owned, operated and controlled by
    Coin Habour Pty Ltd ABN 12 624 879 223, trading as CoinPort, who along with its associated entities, and each of
    their directors, affiliates or employees (as appropriate) are referred to as “we”, “us” or “our” in these Terms of
    Service.</p>
  <p>The Platform provided and operated by CoinPort allows buyers and sellers to buy, sell and trade digital
    currency. “CoinPort” may also refer to the services, website, mobile applications, content, products or any other
    services provided by CoinPort (collectively 'Services')</p>
  <p>By opening an account to use the Services provided by CoinPort, you expressly represent and warrant that you
    have accepted our Terms of Service, and any additional terms and conditions displayed on the Platform (including
    without limitation our Privacy Policy and AML-CTF Policy) as they apply from time to time.</p>
  <p>We grant you a non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable licence to use the software on a server controlled by us
    for the sole purpose of accessing and obtaining the material on the Platform.</p>
  <p>We may amend, modify, add to or delete these Terms of Service at our discretion and those amendments,
    modifications, additions or deletions apply to your use of the Platform and Services as soon as they are displayed
    on the Platform (whether or not you are aware of those amendments, modifications, additions or deletions). All
    subsequent transactions by you will be subject to the amended and most current Terms of Service.</p>
  <p>Your eligibility and use of our Platform and Services is dependent upon your country of residence. The Services
    provided by CoinPort are limited to the following jurisdiction: Australia.</p>

  <h2>Risks of Trading and Holding Crypto or Digital Currencies</h2>
  <p>The trading or holding of coins, tokens, crypto, digital currency, or digital assets of the like (collectively
    'Coins') involves significant risks and the losses can be substantial. You should carefully consider and assess
    whether trading or holding of Coins is suitable for you depending upon your financial circumstances and tolerance to
    risk.</p>
  <p>Coins such as Bitcoin and Ether are unlike traditional currencies, goods or commodities in the market and are
    subject to exceptional risks. Unlike other traditional forms of currency, Coins are decentralised and are not backed
    by a central bank, government or legal entities and remains unregulated. As such, the value of Coins may swing
    depending upon the market, confidence of investors, competing currencies, regulatory announcements or changes,
    technical problems or any other factors.</p>
  <p>Due to the significant risks of trading Coins as well as the impact of technology and the international market,
    CoinPort cannot warrant or guarantee that particular Coins will be available on our Platform and Services.
    CoinPort reserves the right to stop offering trades in relation to particular Coins on our Platform and Services.
    We will use our reasonable endeavours to notify you if we cease to support trading in particular Coins. If this is
    the case, you will not be able to convert Coins into AUD or any other currency, however you will be given the option
    to move the Coins to another user, platform or third party website.</p>
  <p>CoinPort only supports mechanisms such as Metacoins, Alt-Coins, Forks, Sidechains, Colour Coins or any other
    Coins which supplement and interact with digital currency, if CoinPort explicitly specifies through our Platform.
    The Platform will participate in Forks, airdrops and any other similar mechanisms at CoinPort’s absolute
    discretion. CoinPort does not allow for users to send Coins off the CoinPort Platform in order to pay, fund or
    contribute to an Initial Coin Offering unless explicitly stated and will not be responsible for the Coins sent off
    the platform nor the coins or tokens expected to be received from the Initial Coin Offering. CoinPort may also
    support the payment of a dividend, at CoinPort’s absolute discretion and if explicitly stated.</p>
  <p>CoinPort is not responsible or liable for any Coins once they are transferred from our Platform to another site,
    device, platform or user. Nor is CoinPort responsible or liable for any Coins not traded on our Platform that
    have been sent into our Platform or Coins that have been sent to an incorrect wallet address or a wallet address for
    a different Coin. It is important for you to take precautions when transferring and storing your Coins whether on
    our platform or through other sites, wallets or devices. We take no responsibility for misappropriation or theft of
    your Coins. You should familiarise yourself with the security measures available when using a wallet service or
    other device for storage. Always take a greater degree of care and precaution to secure your passwords when
    operating in a digital environment. For more information about how to secure and protect your Coins, see Security
    Recommendations.</p>

  <h2>Trading and Using Your CoinPort Account</h2>
  <p>CoinPort will use its best endeavours to ensure that it meets its deposit and withdrawal timeframes. From
    time-to-time factors outside of CoinPort’s control may lead to delays. You acknowledge that CoinPort is not
    responsible for any losses that occur due to delays in processing deposits or withdrawals.</p>
  <p>By using CoinPort’s Platform and Services, you acknowledge that CoinPort is not responsible for any delays
    you may experience in sending and transferring Coins to and/or from CoinPort’s Platform to other platforms,
    websites, users or wallets. These delays may be due to issues beyond CoinPort’s control, including issues with
    third party websites and platforms, wallets, congestion of the blockchain and CoinPort moving Coins into a secure
    storage vault or platform.</p>
  <p>In addition to buying, selling, converting and trading Coins, you are only permitted to send your Coins to another
    user, platform, website or to your personal wallet. Due to the evolving nature of the technology, any technical
    issues regarding the blockchain and use of the network are beyond CoinPort’s control and CoinPort reserves the
    right to cancel transactions you have initiated which are delayed beyond a reasonable time or lapse due to time
    delays. In such circumstances, you may need to execute the transaction again or at another time.</p>
  <p>In the circumstance where you have received, acquired, or accumulated any funds or assets due to an error, glitch
    or loophole, CoinPort may take reasonable action, including but not limited to restricting access or deducting
    the funds from the account, to recover the funds or assets from your CoinPort account. We will notify you if such
    error has occurred and it is our right to recover the misappropriated funds or assets.</p>
  <p>It is your responsibility to check your CoinPort account and monitor the movement of your Coins including any
    pending, lapsed or cancelled through your transaction history and to re-execute any transactions which fail.</p>
  <p>All deposits and withdrawals made are subject to the limits displayed on our Platform and Services. This amount may
    change from time to time due to the blockchain as well as the user demand, market activity and the price of
    particular Coins.</p>
  <p>All fiat deposits and withdrawals can only be made to and from a financial institution account held by the verified
    CoinPort account holder.</p>
  <p>During periods of market volatility, high volume trades, fast movement and illiquidity in the market, the market
    rate in which you buy, sell or trade Coins may be different to the price indicated on our Platform and as such we
    will be unable to execute your order and will return the funds to your account. CoinPort is not liable for any
    price variation due to market volatility, market or technology disruptions, delays or any other matters that caused
    by things that are outside CoinPort’s control. CoinPort may reasonably decide not to execute a trade if the
    market rate significantly increases or decreases or in the event of a market disruption or other event which is
    outside its control and in such cases CoinPort may cancel your buy/sell order and return the funds into your
    CoinPort account. CoinPort will exercise reasonable care to notify you of these events and when you receive a
    notification you must check your account and any pending or cancelled transactions.</p>

  <h2>Conversion Services and Fees</h2>
  <p>A conversion fee applies to all transactions where Coins are purchased, sold or traded.</p>
  <p>By using the CoinPort Platform, you accept the conversion rate and acknowledge that we may adjust our conversion
    fees at any time. CoinPort will notify you of the conversion fees that apply to your transaction at the time of
    the transaction.</p>
  <p>We may delay, suspend or cancel a conversion transaction if we believe the transaction may be subject to illegal
    activity, fraud, including but not limited to the activities outlined in clause 13.</p>
  <p>We reserve the right to delay, suspend or cancel a trade or transaction if there are technical reasons that prevent
    us from completing the transaction, or if CoinPort is unable to execute the transaction. This may be subject to
    reliance on a third party supplier, where we have reasonable belief that the trade is subject to illegal activity or
    fraud, technical difficulties or subject to a law enforcement action.</p>

  <h2>Termination</h2>
      <p>CoinPort may suspend, limit, restrict, deactivate or terminate your access to CoinPort’s Platform and
        Services, including your CoinPort account, if:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You gain or attempt to gain unauthorised access to the Platform or another CoinPort member’s account;</li>
    <li>There is a technical or operational difficulty;</li>
    <li>You use the CoinPort Platform in order to perform illegal or criminal activities;</li>
    <li>Your use of the CoinPort Platform is subject to any pending investigation, litigation or government
      proceeding;</li>

        trades. You will not be charged any fees for cancelling your CoinPort account, however you must pay any
        outstanding amounts owed to us.</p>

    its associated entities, directors, officers, affiliates, employees, service providers, members, representatives and

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>The transmission of information over the Internet (including to or from the Platform) is not completely secure or
    error free. In particular, emails to or from us and information submitted to or accessed via this Platform may not
    be secure and you should use discretion in deciding what information you send to us via these means.</p>
  <p>Emails to and from us may undergo email filtering and virus scanning, including by third party contractors. We do
    not warrant that such filters and scans will be effective in removing viruses or other potentially harmful code.
  </p>
  <p>You acknowledge that you use the Platform and Services (and obtain and transmit data to it) entirely at your own
    risk, that it is provided on an “as is” basis and that we do not make any representations or warranties as to the
    security, availability of our Platform and Services or that your access or use will be uninterrupted, timely or
    secure.</p>
  <p>CoinPort securely stores Coin private keys and other information in order to maintain the security and
    integrity of the system. We are committed to protecting users’ Coins and other information we collect from you and
    hold in highly secure data centres operated by a third party. The datacentres used have ISO 270014, 270175 and
    270186 certifications and PCI DSS7 compliance. This has been independently audited by third parties. ISO 27018
    certification has also been achieved for our data centre partners, which demonstrates a system of controls in place
    that specifically address the privacy protection of customer content. We ensure that your information is safe by
    managing access controls, such as identity, access management, permissions and security credentials. Access to
    personal information is only granted to an employee of CoinPort to carry out duties required to support our
    customers. Strong, multi-factor authentication is used and access is revoked when no longer required.</p>
  <p>CoinPort uses a two-factor authentication process in order to verify your identity, maintain security and
    prevent any fraud.</p>
  <p>As part of CoinPort’s commitment to protecting your Coins, all significant financial and trading transactions
    made by you from the CoinPort Platform to another third party website, platform or user, as well as all AUD
    withdrawals from the Platform to your personal bank account, may be required to be performed using CoinPort’s
    two-factor authentication. CoinPort users may be required to implement and use two-factor authentication for all
    withdrawals and transactions to buy, sell and trade Coins. It is your responsibility to implement such measures,
    programs and applications onto your computer and/or phone, such as Google authenticator, and how to use these
    security measures in order to complete the transaction.</p>
  <p>As part of operating our Platform and Services, CoinPort may hold your funds, assets or Coins on different
    exchange platforms.</p>
  <p>By using our Platform and Services, you agree to provide us with current, accurate and complete information,
    including any personal information, and agree to keep such information up to date.</p>
  <p>CoinPort may provide your personal information or any other information such as your IP address or when your
    account was last accessed if requested by a law enforcement agency or government agency.</p>
  <p>By creating a CoinPort account, you authorise CoinPort to make enquiries to verify your identity either
    directly or through third parties, in order to protect our Platform, Services and other users against fraud. In
    order to verify your account, you will provide us with personal information which will be verified against databases
    in your country, as such it is imperative that you provide us with accurate and up-to-date information. The
    verification of your identity and on-boarding of your account may take up to 10 business days to complete. You
    represent and warrant that the information you provide to us through our Platform is correct and up-to-date.</p>
  <p>We cannot guarantee the identity of any other user, receiver or other party you engage with.</p>
  <p>You agree that you will not use any other CoinPort account other than your own account, or access the account
    of another member or assist others in obtaining unauthorised access. If you use or obtain access to a CoinPort
    account, other than your own, this will result in immediate suspension and possible termination of your account. Any
    pending transactions or trades will also be suspended.</p>
  <p>You are accountable for maintaining and preserving the confidentiality of your account information, your personal
    information you provide to CoinPort, the strength level of your password, whether you implement a two-factor
    authentication (unless otherwise stipulated in these Terms of Service), protecting your Coins by using a digital
    wallet and any other activities you undertake when using our Platform and Services. CoinPort recommends you
    implement and use two-factor authentication at all times when transacting on the Platform and a digital wallet to
    protect your crypto and Coins as well as personal information when holding your Coins outside the Platform. Do not
    hold large numbers of Coins within the Platform as this is a security risk and may increase your exposure to hacking
    and misappropriation of your Coins.</p>
  <p>You must notify CoinPort immediately of any unauthorised access or use of your account, password or any other
    applicable breach of our Platform and Services by submitting a support request on our website.</p>
