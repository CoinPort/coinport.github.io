<h1>CoinPort Early Stage Innovation Company (ESIC)</h1>
<a href="https://doc.coinport.com.au/invest/" target="_blank">Return to main Coin Harbour Pty Ltd Investor page.</a><br>

<p>Our intention is to qualify COIN HARBOUR PTY LTD ABN: 12 624 879 223 as an Early Stage Innovation Company (ESIC) in accordance with Division 360 of the <i>Income Tax Assessment Act 1997.</i></p>

<h2>Tax Incentives</h2>
<p>The tax incentives provide eligible investors who purchase new shares in an ESIC with a:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Non-refundable carry forward tax offset equal to 20% of the amount paid for their eligible investments. This is capped at a maximum tax offset amount of $200,000 for the investor and their affiliates combined in each income year</li>
    <li>Modified capital gains tax (CGT) treatment, under which capital gains on qualifying shares that are continuously held for at least 12 months and less than 10 years may be disregarded. Capital losses on shares held less than 10 years must be disregarded.</li>
</ol>

<h2>ESIC Qualification Tests</h2>
<p>To qualify as an ESIC the company must meet the <b>Early Stage Test</b> and either <b>Principles-based Innovation Test</b> OR <b>100-point Innovation Test</b> requirements.</p>
<p>For an investor to be entitled to the tax incentives, the company must qualify as an early stage innovation company (ESIC) immediately after the new shares are issued to the investor. If the company no longer meets the ESIC requirements after this test time, this won't affect the investor's entitlement to the early stage investor tax incentives.</p>

<h3>Early Stage Test Requirements</h3>
<p>To meet the early stage test, the company must meet four requirements.</p>
<p>These requirements are tested at the point in time immediately after the company issues the shares to the investor. If a company doesn't meet all of the requirements at that time, the investor won't qualify for the tax incentives in relation to those shares.</p>
<p>The four requirements are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The company must have been incorporated or registered in the Australian Business Register <b>- Pass</b></li>
<li>The company (plus any wholly-owned subsidiaries of the company) must have total expenses of $1 million or less in the previous income year <b>- Pass</b></li>
<li>The company (plus any wholly-owned subsidiaries of the company) must have assessable income of $200,000 or less in the previous income year <b>- Pass</b></li>
<li>The company's equity interests are not listed for quotation in the official list of any stock exchange, either in Australia or a foreign country. <b>- Pass</b></li>
</ol>

<h3>Principles-based Innovation Test Requirements</h3>
<p>There are five requirements of the principles-based innovation test:</p>
<ol>
<li>The company must be genuinely focused on developing one or more new or significantly improved innovations for commercialisation. <b>- Pass</b></li>
<li>The business relating to that innovation must have a high growth potential. <b>- Pass</b></li>
<li>The company must demonstrate that it has the potential to be able to successfully scale up that business. <b>- Pass</b></li>
<li>The company must demonstrate that it has the potential to be able to address a broader than local market, including global markets, through that business. <b>- Pass</b></li>
<li>The company must demonstrate that it has the potential to be able to have competitive advantages for that business. <b>- Pass</b></li>
</ol>

<h3>100-point innovation test requirements</h3>
<p>To qualify under the 100-point innovation test, the company must obtain at least 100 points by meeting certain objective innovation criteria. This is tested immediately after the relevant shares are issued to the investor (the test time).</p>
<p>Our assesment is the Coin Harbour Pty Ltd meets the criteria for the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>75 points</b> - At least 50% of the company's total expenses for the previous income year are eligible notional deductions for the research and development tax incentive.</li>
<li><b>50 points</b> - One or more third parties have previously paid a total of at least $50,000 for the issue of new shares in the company.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our assesment is that CoinPort qualifies using the "100 Points" test and may possibly also qualify using the "Principles-based" test.</p> <a href="https://doc.coinport.com.au/esic/Questions_ESIC_decision_tool.pdf" target="_blank">ESIC Decision Tool - Principles-based</a><a href="https://doc.coinport.com.au/esic/Questions_ESIC_decision_tool.pdf" target="_blank">ESIC Decision Tool - Principles-based</a>

<h2>Tax Offset</h2>
<p>The early stage investor tax offset is generally equal to 20% of the total amount paid (including non-cash benefits) in return for the qualifying shares. Investors and their affiliates are entitled to a maximum offset of $200,000 in an income year. This includes any offsets that are carried forward from prior years' investments and offsets claimed on indirect investments.</p>
<p>If you don't meet the sophisticated investor test, the maximum early stage investor tax offset you can claim is $10,000, because your total annual investment in all qualifying ESICs cannot exceed $50,000.</p>
<p>Tax offsets directly reduce the amount of tax you have to pay, with each dollar of tax offset reducing your tax payable by the same amount. As the early stage investor tax offset is a non-refundable tax offset, it can reduce your amount of tax payable to zero, but it cannot result in a tax refund on its own.</p>

<h2>CGT Benefits</h2>
<p>You can disregard a capital gain that you make from a CGT event happening to qualifying shares if you have held them continuously for 12 months or more but less than ten years.</p>
