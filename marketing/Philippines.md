Here‚Äôs a **step-by-step guide** to entering the Philippine market, including **regulatory requirements, costs, and strategies** for success.

### **1. Why the Philippines?**  
‚úÖ **High Crypto Adoption**  
   - **6th globally** in crypto adoption (Chainalysis 2023).  
   - **20M+ crypto users** (~18% of population).  
   - **Remittances**: $40B/year market (many use crypto for cross-border transfers).

   - **SEC** oversees token offerings (similar to ASIC in Australia).

   - Crypto promoted via **local influencers, Telegram groups, and e-wallets** (GCash, Maya).  

‚ö† **Challenges**  
   - **Strict AML rules** (similar to AUSTRAC).  
   - **Banking access** can be slow for foreign firms.  
   - **Competition** from **Coins.ph** (local leader) and Binance (still popular despite ban).

New Zealand

Expanding into **New Zealand (NZ)** offers **moderate difficulty but strong potential** for **CoinPort**, given the country‚Äôs crypto-friendly regulations, high retail adoption, and proximity to Australia. However, **limited market size and banking hurdles** require careful planning.  

---

### **1. Why New Zealand?**  
‚úÖ **Strong Crypto Adoption**  
   - **~10% of NZ adults** own crypto (higher than AU per capita).  
   - **High trust in regulated exchanges** (e.g., Easy Crypto, Dasset).  

‚úÖ **Clear Regulations**  
   - **Financial Markets Authority (FMA)** oversees crypto under **Financial Service Providers (FSP) regime**.  
   - **No specific crypto license**, but AML/CFT registration required.  
   - **Tax clarity**: Crypto is taxable but not treated as currency.  

‚úÖ **Low Competition**  
   - Dominated by **Easy Crypto** (OTC-focused) and **Dasset** (small exchange).  
   - **No dominant AUD/NZD exchange** (opportunity for CoinPort).  

‚ö† **Challenges**  
   - **Small market** (5M population vs. Australia‚Äôs 26M).  
   - **Banking access** can be slow for crypto businesses.  
   - **Stablecoin uncertainty** (no NZD-backed stablecoins).  

---

### **2. Step-by-Step Expansion Plan**  

#### **Step 1: Register as a Financial Service Provider (FSP)**  
   - **Requirements**:  
     - **AML/CFT compliance** (similar to AUSTRAC).  
     - Local entity or branch registration.  
     - **No minimum capital**, but banking partners may require reserves.  
   - **Timeline**: **3‚Äì6 months**.  

#### **Step 2: Partner with NZ Banks & Payment Providers**  
   - **Banks**: Work with **ASB, ANZ NZ, or Wise NZ** for NZD rails.

#### **Step 3: Localize Offerings**  
   - **Focus on**:  
     - **AUD/NZD pairs** (untapped by major exchanges).  
     - **Tax tools** (NZ users need crypto tax reporting).  
   - **Marketing**: Leverage **Kiwi influencers** (e.g., Crypto Girl NZ).  

#### **Step 4: Differentiate from Competitors**  
   - **Target gaps**:  
     - **Better liquidity** vs. Dasset‚Äôs low volumes.  
     - **Staking/yield products** (Easy Crypto doesn‚Äôt offer).

---
