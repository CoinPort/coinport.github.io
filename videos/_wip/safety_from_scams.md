### **🚨 Tip #1: Never Share Private Keys or Seed Phrases**  
**[Scene: A "seed phrase" (12-word backup) on paper gets locked in a vault, while a hacker’s hand gets zapped trying to grab it.]**  

**Leonie:**  
*"Your seed phrase is the master key to your crypto. **No legitimate company—not CoinPort, not Ledger, not Ethereum—will EVER ask for it.** If someone does, it’s a scam!"*  

---  

### **🚨 Tip #2: Double-Check URLs & Emails**  
**[Scene: A fake "CoinPort-support.com" phishing site crumbles, revealing the real "CoinPort.com" underneath.]**  

**Leonie:**  
*"Scammers love fake websites that look like real exchanges. Always check the URL—**typos like ‘CoinPortt.com’ or ‘CoinPort-support.org’ are red flags.** And never click links in suspicious emails!"*  

---  

### **🚨 Tip #3: Ignore "Too Good to Be True" Offers**  
**[Scene: A flashy "Send 1 ETH, Get 10 ETH FREE!" banner explodes into a "SCAM" warning sign.]**  

**Leonie:**  
*"Free crypto? Celebrity giveaways? **If it sounds too good to be true, it is.** Elon Musk isn’t giving away Bitcoin, and that YouTube ‘live stream’ of a giveaway is fake!"*  

---  

### **🚨 Tip #4: Verify Social Media & Admins**  
**[Scene: A scammer’s fake "CoinPort Admin" Telegram account gets a giant "FAKE" stamp, while the real CoinPort logo shines.]**  

**Leonie:**  
*"Scammers impersonate support teams on Telegram, Twitter, and Discord. **Official staff will NEVER DM you first.** Always verify accounts through our website—not Google or social media ads!"*  

---  

### **🚨 Tip #5: Use Hardware Wallets for Big Holdings**  
**[Scene: A hacker’s computer fails to access a crypto wallet, while a Ledger device sits safely offline.]**  

**Leonie:**  
*"Keeping large amounts on exchanges or hot wallets? Risky! **A $100 hardware wallet could save you thousands.** Remember: Not your keys, not your crypto!"*
