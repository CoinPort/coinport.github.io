5.1.1 The risk of loss of access to the KUN tokens as a result of the loss of private keys, storage errors or negligence of the User.
5.1.2 Risks associated with the blockchain protocol. Since KUN tokens are based on the blockchain protocol, any malfunctions of the blockchain protocol can have a material adverse effect on the Site or KUN tokens. Moreover, improvements in cryptography, or technical improvements such as the development of quantum computing, can pose a risk to KUN tokens, including the usefulness of KUN tokens.
5.1.3. The risk of mining attacks.
5.1.4. Hacking risks and security flaws.

Even if the secondary trade in KUN tokens is provided by third-party trading platforms or exchanges, such third parties can be relatively new and subject to minimal or no regulatory oversight at all, which makes them more susceptible to market risks. In addition, to the extent that third parties attribute the value of an external exchange to the tokens (for example, as indicated in a digital or fixed currency), this value can be extremely volatile and decrease to zero.

Regulatory actions can have a negative impact on the Site and KUN tokens in various ways.

5.1.9. The risk of alternative platforms. The User should understand that if KUN tokens are integrated into other platforms, including trading platforms and exchangers, then each of these alternative platforms has its own technical, technical, regulatory risks, security risks for which the Project is not responsible.
5.1.10. The risks of deficiencies or exploitation in the field of cryptography. Improvements in cryptography, or technical improvements such as the development of quantum solvers, can pose risks to cryptocurrencies on both the blockchain protocol and the KUN tokens, which can lead to theft or loss of tokens.
5.1.11. The risk of lack of interest in the Site, technologies or KUN tokens. It is possible that the Site will not be used by a large number of other users. This lack of use or interest may adversely affect the development of the Site and the potential usefulness of KUN tokens.
5.1.12. The risk of termination of the Project and the Site.
5.1.13. Unexpected risks. Cryptographic tokens, such as KUN tokens, is a new and untested technology. In addition to the above risks, there are other risks associated with the purchase, storage and use of KUN tokens, including those that the Parties cannot foresee. Such risks may arise as unforeseen or as combinations of risks foreseen above.
5.2. The parties are exempt from liability for partial or complete non-fulfillment of obligations under this Agreement, if this failure was the result of force majeure circumstances that arose after the conclusion of the Agreement as a result of emergency events that the parties could neither foresee nor prevent by reasonable measures.
