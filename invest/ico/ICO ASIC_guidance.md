ICO ASIC 

According to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), conducting an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) or similar fundraising methods in Australia is legal, but it is subject to specific regulations and compliance requirements under the Corporations Act 2001 and the ASIC Act 2001. These regulations are detailed in ASIC's Information Sheet 225 (INFO 225).

INFO 225 outlines various considerations for businesses involved with crypto-assets, including those considering raising funds through an ICO. The sheet emphasizes that if the crypto-asset or ICO is classified as a 'financial product', Australian laws will apply. This includes the requirement to hold an Australian Financial Services License (AFSL) with the appropriate authorizations.

ASIC's guidance highlights the risks associated with an ICO or crypto-asset being considered a managed investment scheme (MIS). If the tokens are not available for use on an existing platform, there is a significant risk that your tokens could be characterized as an MIS. In such cases, an AFSL with the appropriate authorizations would be required.

Furthermore, ASIC's guidance covers scenarios where ICOs and offerings of crypto-assets will be considered a security. For instance, if a crypto-asset gives a purchaser the right to acquire shares in a company at a future time, it may be considered an option, which is a type of security.

The regulatory environment around crypto-assets and ICOs is complex and evolving. ASIC's approach to regulation and enforcement aims to provide certainty and safeguard consumers and the integrity of financial markets in Australia. Entities considering ICOs or dealing with crypto-assets are advised to seek professional advice and engage with regulators appropriately, ensuring that their operations comply with current Australian laws and regulations.
