  <h1>CoinPort Document Retention Policy</h1>

  <h2>Reasons for Policy</h2>
  <p>The corporate information of Coin Port Pty Ltd is important to how it conducts business and manages employees.
  </p>
  <p>Federal law requires Coin Port Pty Ltd to retain certain records, usually for a specific amount of time. The
    accidental or intentional destruction of these records during their specified retention periods could result in the
    following consequences for Coin Port Pty Ltd and/or its employees:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Fines and penalties.</li>
    <li>Loss of rights.</li>
    <li>Obstruction of justice charges.</li>
    <li>Inference of spoliation of evidence and spoliation tort claims.</li>
    <li>Contempt of court charges.</li>
    <li>Serious disadvantages in litigation.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Coin Port Pty Ltd must retain certain records because they contain information that:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Serves as Coin Port Pty Ltd’s corporate memory.</li>
    <li>Has enduring business value (for example, it provides a record of a business transaction, evidences Coin Port
      Pty Ltd’s rights or obligations, protects Coin Port Pty Ltd’s legal interests or ensures operational
      continuity).</li>
    <li>Must be kept to satisfy legal, accounting or other regulatory requirements.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Coin Port Pty Ltd prohibits the inappropriate destruction of any records, files, documents, samples and other
    forms of information. This policy is in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, under which it is a crime to
    change, conceal, falsify or destroy any record with the intent to impede or obstruct any official or government
    proceeding. Therefore, this policy is part of a company-wide system for the review, retention and destruction of
    records Coin Port Pty Ltd creates or receives in connection with the business it conducts.</p>

  <h2>Types of Documents</h2>
  <p>This policy explains the differences among records, disposable information and confidential information belonging
    to others.</p>
  <h3>Records.</h3>
  <p>A record is any type of information created, received or transmitted in the transaction of Coin Port Pty
    Ltd’s business, regardless of physical format. Examples of where the various types of information are located are:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Appointment books and calendars.</li>
    <li>Audio and video recordings.</li>
    <li>Computer programs.</li>
    <li>Contracts.</li>
    <li>Electronic files.</li>
    <li>E-mails.</li>
    <li>Handwritten notes.</li>
    <li>Invoices.</li>
    <li>Letters and other correspondence.</li>
    <li>Magnetic tape.</li>
    <li>Memory in cell phones and PDAs.</li>
    <li>Online postings, such as on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, Vine and other sites.</li>
    <li>Performance reviews.</li>
    <li>Test samples.</li>
    <li>Voicemails.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Therefore, any paper records and electronic files, including any records of donations made online, that are part of
    any of the categories listed in the Records Retention Schedule contained in the Appendix to this policy, must be
    retained for the amount of time indicated in the Records Retention Schedule. A record must not be retained beyond
    the period indicated in the Record Retention Schedule, unless a valid business reason (or a litigation hold or other
    special situation) calls for its continued retention. If you are unsure whether to retain a certain record, contact
    the Records Management Officer or the Legal Department.</p>

  <h3>Disposable Information.</h3>
  <p>Disposable information consists of data that may be discarded or deleted at the discretion of the user once it has
    served its temporary useful purpose and/or data that may be safely destroyed because it is not a record as defined
    by this policy. Examples may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Duplicates of originals that have not been annotated.</li>
    <li>Preliminary drafts of letters, memoranda, reports, worksheets and informal notes that do not represent
      significant steps or decisions in the preparation of an official record.</li>
    <li>Books, periodicals, manuals, training binders and other printed materials obtained from sources outside of Coin
      Harbour Pty Ltd and retained primarily for reference purposes.</li>
    <li>Spam and junk mail.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Confidential Information Belonging to Others.</h3>
  <p>Any confidential information that an employee may have obtained from a source outside of Coin Port Pty Ltd, such
    as a previous employer, must not, so long as such information remains confidential, be disclosed to or used by Coin
    Harbour Pty Ltd. Unsolicited confidential information submitted to Coin Port Pty Ltd should be refused, returned
    to the sender where possible and deleted, if received via the internet.</p>

  <h2>Mandatory Compliance</h2>
  <p>Responsibility of All Employees. Coin Port Pty Ltd strives to comply with the laws, rules and regulations by
    which it is governed and with recognized compliance practices. All company employees must comply with this policy,
    the Records Retention Schedule and any litigation hold communications. Failure to do so may subject Coin Port Pty
    Ltd, its employees and contract staff to serious civil and/or criminal liability. An employee’s failure to comply
    with this policy may result in disciplinary sanctions, including suspension or termination.</p>
  <p>Reporting Policy Violations. Coin Port Pty Ltd is committed to enforcing this policy as it applies to all forms
    of records. The effectiveness of Coin Port Pty Ltd’s efforts, however, depends largely on employees. If you feel

    supervisor. If you are not comfortable bringing the matter up with your immediate supervisor, or do not believe the
    supervisor has dealt with the matter properly, you should raise the matter with the Compliance Manager. If employees
    do not report inappropriate conduct, Coin Port Pty Ltd may not become aware of a possible violation of this
    policy and may not be able to take appropriate corrective action. No one will be subject to and Coin Port Pty Ltd
    prohibits, any form of discipline, reprisal, intimidation or retaliation for reporting incidents of inappropriate
    conduct of any kind, pursuing any record destruction claim or cooperating in related investigations.</p>

    duplicated and/or backed up at least once per week and maintained off site.</p>
  <p>Destruction. Coin Port Pty Ltd’s [Records Management Officer/OTHER OFFICER/MANAGER] is responsible for the

    coordinated with the IT Department [TITLE].</p>
  <p>The destruction of records must stop immediately upon notification from [the Legal Department] that a litigation

    relevant to current litigation, potential litigation (that is, a dispute that could result in litigation),
    government investigation, audit or other event, you must preserve and not delete, dispose, destroy or change those
    records, including e-mails, until [the Legal Department] determines those records are no longer needed. This
    exception is referred to as a litigation hold or legal hold, replaces any previously or subsequently established
    destruction schedule for those records. If you believe this exception may apply, or have any questions regarding
    whether it may possibly apply, please contact [the Legal Department].</p>
  <p>In addition, you may be asked to suspend any routine document disposal procedures in connection with certain other
