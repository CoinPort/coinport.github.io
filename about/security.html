<h1>360-Degree Security</h1>
<p>We safeguard user funds by securing our platform with strict protocols and industry-leading technical measures. From real-time monitoring and a 360-degree risk management system to advanced data privacy tools and end user security education, we continually find innovative ways to protect the users we serve.</p>

<h2>Platform Security</h2>

<h3>Secure Storage</h3>
<p>The vast majority of user funds and assets are safely stored in offline, cold wallet storage facilities.</p>

<h3>Real Time Monitoring</h3>
<p>Our risk management system analyzes every withdrawal attempt, password reset, two-factor authentication reset and email address change. Unusual activity triggers suspended withdrawals for a minimum of 24-48 hours.</p>

<h3>Organizational Security</h3>
<p>Our wallet and personnel infrastructure features advanced security measures, including multisignature and threshold signature schemes (TSS), ensure the safety and integrity of our users’ funds.</p>

<h3>Advanced Data Encryption</h3>
<p>We protect user data and personal information, including Know-Your-Customer (KYC) information, by encrypting data in storage. Meanwhile, data in transit is secured via end-to-end encryption, ensuring only users have access to their personal information.</p>

<h2>User-Level Security</h2>

<h3>Safe Sign In</h3>
<p>CoinPort supports strict sign-in protocols using two-factor authentication, including hardware, app-based, SMS and email methods.</p>

<h3>Access Control</h3>
<p>Advanced access control provides users with opt-in security features such as IP and wallet address whitelisting, API access control and device management.</p>

<h3>Security Notifications</h3>
<p>Receive emails, notifications and security alerts in the event that suspicious activity is detected. Users can secure their account by restricting access to unwanted third parties.</p>

<h2>Opening New Doors for Crypto</h2>
<p>We’re committed to meeting the highest standards for regulatory compliance, in order to maintain our responsibility to our users and further develop the blockchain industry.</p>
