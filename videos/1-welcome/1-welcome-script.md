Coin Harbour has been developed to make access to the digital asset crypto markets easy, fast and safe. Users can buy or sell crypto assets with a couple of mouse clicks with our “Instant buy” function.

Coin Harbour is more than an exchange, we also provide a "market maker" service so that customers can always and instantly buy or sell for a given market. We provide markets for all of the common cryptocurrencies and add new coins as they become popular.

We do not charge exchange trading fees or commissions, so there are no unexpected costs and trading is simple. The price on the screen is what is paid. We want to make using Coin harbour a fuss-free experience.

Before withdrawing funds or cryptocurrency from Coin harbour your identity needs to be verified. This is required to comply with AUSTRAC rules.

KYC means "Know your client", AML is "Anti-money laundering" and CTF is "counter-terrorism funding". It basically means that we need to identify customers properly and also report and suspect activity to AUSTRAC

The KYC process is completed online, and once your documents are ready for upload should only take a few minutes. We have a separate video that covers the customer KYC process.
Client funds are kept in separate and segregated bank accounts for your peace of mind. CoinHarbour is licensed in Australia as a digital asset exchange and money remitter. All assets are held in safe custody on a one-to-one basis.
