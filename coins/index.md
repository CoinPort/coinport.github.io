## CoinPort Coin and Token Images

This is the web folder where static images for the public-facing site are stored.

We store images seperately to improve caching and page loading speed for the main website.

All coin/token images are stored in Portable Network Graphic (PNG) format, a type of raster image file".

By default these images are 128 * 128 in size.

The syntax is that the coin image file name is based on the coin/token code Eg. Bitcoin is "BTC", so the file image name is "btc.png"

The full reference would be https://doc.coinport.com.au/coins/btc.png
