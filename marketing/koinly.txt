koinly

This is what we would need for each transaction listed in the file:
- Timestamp. UTC is preferred but other timezones are fine if the timezone is specified somehow so that we can detect it.
- Transaction type. We will need to know what kind of transaction we're dealing with (ex: deposit, trade, airdrop, bonus, etc)
- Currency
- Amount

It is also useful to have the following information:
- Trade ID or order ID (for trades)
- Fee amount and fee currency (I saw that you don't charge specific fees, in which case this is not needed)
- Address sent to or received from (for deposits and withdrawals)
- Any further information or description that could help the user identify or remember the transaction (ie. something that Koinly would add as a note to the transaction)

Other notes:
- Koinly needs the users' entire transaction history, starting from the day that the account was created
- Koinly needs all transaction types, including deposits and withdrawals as well as things like fees, commission, bonuses, rewards, etc (basically anything that affects the user's balances counts as a transaction for us). Fiat transactions are nice to have as well but not necessary for the calculations or reports.
- For trades, you will need to report both the currency that was spent as well as the currency received. There are a couple of ways to report trades but there are two good examples here if you would like to check that out (formats 2 and 3). It is most convenient for us if a single trade can be reported in a single line in the file but it is also possible to split this into two lines where each line represents one part of the trade (one line for the received assets and one line for the spent assets). If you do split trades into two lines then it is important that you include trade/order IDs so that we can merge the trades on our side.
- It is up to you if you would like to provide all transactions in a single file/format or if you would like to split this into different formats (most commonly one file for trades and one file for everything else).
