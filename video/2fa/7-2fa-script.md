Two factor authentication, known as "2FA", is an identity and access management security method that requires two forms of identification to access resources and data. 2FA helps customers safeguard their accounts.

Two factor authentication provides an extra level of security beyond your user name and password.

After enabling Two-factor authentication you will need a time sensitive six digit code, also called a one time password, to sign in to the Coin Harbour exchange.
