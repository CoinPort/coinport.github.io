There are additional roles and responsibilities at each level of the organisation.

#### The board

Board members must disclose any actual, potential or perceived conflicts of interests as they arise. Conflict of interest is a standing agenda item at board meetings and disclosures are recorded in the meeting minutes, detailing the name of the board director with the conflict, the type of conflict and how the board managed it.

The board should also monitor and review Coin Habour Pty Ltd’s conflict of interest register, ensuring all items are appropriately managed.

#### CEO and executive team

The CEO and executive team monitor and review the conflict of interest register, ensure this policy is being followed, and model integrity and transparent behaviour.

Compliance and Risk Manager is responsible for ensuring that, prior to engaging an independent contractor and or auditor, potential conflicts of interest are explored and managed accordingly. Managers and team leaders

The manager responsible for risk management at Coin Habour Pty Ltd maintains the conflict of interest register.

The Support Manager ensures that conflict of interest is explained to staff during induction, including potential conflicts arising from multiple employers, personal relationships, and gifts. Information and practical guidance on managing conflicts is also provided.

All managers and team leaders should:

*   Provide direction in implementing this policy and model expected behaviour
*   Participate in conflict of interest resolution with their team
*   Manage breaches to this policy
*   Ensure their teams have the information required to comply with all relevant legislation, operational guidelines, or instructions about conflict of interest from funding and regulatory bodies. Workers involved in direct service delivery

### 1.7 Monitoring and review

The size and governance structure of an organisation will determine who is responsible for the conflict of interest policy. It is recommended that the board, audit and risk committee and CEO are involved in the monitoring and review of the conflict of interest policy.

The Board will review this policy annually to ensure its continued application and relevance.

Individual conflicts will be monitored, reviewed, and updated on the conflict of interest register as required. All conflicts will be reviewed at least annually.

## 2\. Procedure

This procedure sets out the steps required to achieve the expectations laid out in the above policy. Conflicts arise in numerous circumstances. Regardless of the type of conflict, all conflicts must be declared so that they may be managed appropriately. Examples of scenarios where conflicts may occur include:

*   Relationship with family or friends
*   Staff recruitment
*   Work activities outside Coin Habour Pty Ltd (paid/unpaid)
*   Personal relationships with internal and/or external parties
*   Financial interest
*   Disposal of assets
*   Gifts/benefits
*   Provision of external consultancy services
*   Procurement of goods and services.

### 2.1 Disclosing conflicts of interest

All actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest are to be reported to the relevant line manager as soon as possible, by the worker involved in, or identifying, the conflict. This should be via the quickest and most effective method available. The worker must also submit a conflict of interest declaration form to their line manager, within 48 hours of identifying the conflict.

If a worker has knowledge that a conflict of interest involving another worker may exist that may not have been disclosed, they should discuss the situation with their line manager and follow Coin Habour Pty Ltd whistleblowing policy and procedure.

The line manager should liaise with the manager responsible for risk management to determine how the conflict of interest will be managed and by whom.

The relevant manager must inform the CEO immediately if the conflict poses an immediate risk to a worker, consumer, member or the public, or the integrity or reputation of the organisation. If the CEO is unavailable, an executive manager should be informed. The CEO, or their delegate, will take action to reduce the risk to an acceptable level.

When board directors or sub‐committee members have a conflict of interest, the conflict is reported to the meeting members and recorded in the meeting minutes, as per the relevant charter/terms of business.

### 2.2 Management plan

The line manager, manager responsible for risk management and worker involved in the conflict of interest are responsible for developing a management plan.

The four recommended responses are:

*   Avoid the conflict of interest: This is the preferred response when a conflict poses an unacceptable risk to, or impact on, a worker, consumer, member of the public, or the organisation. To avoid a conflict of interest, the worker concerned may be removed from the situation causing conflict or asked to relinquish the private interest creating the conflict.
*   Accept and reduce the conflict of interest: A conflict of interest may be reduced by ensuring that the worker concerned has restrictions placed on their involvement in the relevant matter, or that another worker or organisational area takes responsibility for the matter.
*   Share the conflict of interest: A conflict of interest may be shared by involving a third party to oversee part, or all, of the decision-making process that deals with the relevant matter.
*   Retain the conflict of interest: A conflict of interest may be retained, and the worker continues to be involved in the matter concerned, subject to a regular review of the situation. This response is only suitable for low risk conflicts of interest.

### 2.3 Communicate

The relevant manager must communicate actual, potential, or perceived conflict of interests to all affected individuals and/or organisations, including information on:

*   How the individual and/or organisation is affected
*   Any risks associated with the conflict
*   How Coin Habour Pty Ltd is managing the conflict.

Coin Habour Pty Ltd must also:

*   Update the individual and/or organisation if there are any changes to the conflict
*   Use the language, mode of communication and terms that the individual and/or organisation is most likely to understand.

### 2.4 Monitor and review

The manager responsible for risk management must:

*   Enter all new conflicts of interest on to the conflict of interest register, updating as required
*   Maintain the register, ensuring all conflicts are reviewed at least annually
*   Review the register on a monthly basis and provide a summary report to the CEO and executive management team.

The CEO, or their delegate, will:

*   Report new, or changed, conflicts of interest to the board at each board meeting, as part of the CEO’s report
*   Rrovide the full conflict of interest register to the board on a six-monthly basis for review.

All conflict must be reviewed on at least an annual basis, to ensure that the information remains correct, and that the management responses continue to be appropriate and effective.
