1. GENERAL PROVISIONS

Policy applies to any deposit of a Coin Hartbour-supported currency or token sent to the blockchain address of another coin on another network. For example, this includes but is not limited to sending BTC to a BCH address or sending ETH to an ETC address.

The User must understand that a cross-chain deposit Refund is a complicated and time-consuming process. Not all cross-chain deposits can be recovered. Coin Hartbour will do as much as possible to return money that has been lost as a result of wrong deposit in the shortest term as Coin Hartbour can.

Coin Hartbour will not refund unsupported tokens including ICOs, airdrops, or blockchain forks.

Taking into account complexity of the issues connected with the refund process, the User must pay Refund Attempt Fee ("Fee"). Fee equals 1000 euro or cryptocurrency equivalent, payable in fiat or cryptocurrency supported by Coin Hartbour. Fee is payable beforehand and deduct from the User`s wallet. The User must understand that Coin Hartbour does not guarantee successful completion of the cross-chain refund process. No other fees will not apply for the User.

Cross-chain refunds in excess of the original amount are prohibited.

This Policy does not cover any transactions between the Users related to purchase-sale of crypto-currencies and it does not refer to any refunds for purchased crypto-currencies.

To realize the User's right to a refund they shall contact Coin Hartbour Support Service. The User`s application must include the following information:

the email address to which the User's Account is attached;
the name of the electronic token that was mistakenly deposited in a wallet intended for another cryptocurrency;
the number of electronic tokens; txid, transaction screenshot.
Coin Hartbour may require additional information about the transaction, if necessary. If recovery and return of mistakenly deposited electronic tokens is possible, Coin Hartbour may need to install or update the wallet software, export/import secret keys, etc.
