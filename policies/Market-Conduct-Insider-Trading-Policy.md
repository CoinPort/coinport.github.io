### **1.0 POLICY STATEMENT**

All personnel are strictly prohibited from engaging in, or facilitating, market manipulation, insider trading, or any conduct that could undermine confidence in the cryptocurrency markets or breach financial services laws.

### **5.0 PERSONAL ACCOUNT DEALING RULES & PROCEDURES**

#### **5.1 Pre-Clearance Requirement**
*   **Covered Persons:** All **Tier 1 (High Risk)** employees (e.g., Compliance, Trading, Finance, Senior Developers with production access) and **Designated Persons** identified by the CCO must obtain **pre-clearance** for **every** personal trade in any Crypto Asset.
*   **Procedure for Pre-Clearance:**
    1.  Submit a request via the dedicated **Personal Trading Pre-Clearance Portal** at least **24 hours** prior to the intended trade.
    2.  The request must specify: Asset, intended action (Buy/Sell), approximate size/amount, and broker/exchange (if external).
    3.  The **Compliance Team** will review the request against the MNPI Log, Restricted Periods, and blackout windows. Approval/Denial is typically provided within 4 business hours.
    4.  **Execution & Reporting:** The trade must be executed within **48 hours** of approval. A confirmation of trade execution (screenshot/statement) must be uploaded to the Portal within **72 hours** of execution.

#### **5.2 Mandatory Holding Periods**
*   All personal Crypto Asset purchases by **Covered Persons** must be held for a minimum of **30 calendar days** ("Minimum Hold Rule") to discourage short-term speculative trading. Exceptions require prior written approval from the CCO.

#### **5.3 Account Declarations & Brokerage**
1.  **Account Disclosure:** All Restricted Persons must disclose **all** cryptocurrency exchange accounts, wallets (hot and cold), and brokerage accounts used for personal trading to Compliance upon commencement and annually thereafter.
2.  **Use of CoinPort:** Restricted Persons are **discouraged** from using the CoinPort exchange for active personal trading. If used, the account must be tagged for compliance monitoring.
3.  **External Accounts:** Compliance may, with employee consent, request periodic statements from external exchanges for monitoring purposes as a condition of employment for Covered Persons.

#### **5.4 Blackout & Restricted Periods**
*   Trading is prohibited for **all** Restricted Persons during any announced **Restricted Period** (e.g., prior to earnings releases, major platform upgrades, or new listing announcements).
*   **Covered Persons** may be subject to **individual blackout periods** if they are privy to specific, ongoing MNPI (e.g., during a security investigation or a pending large client deal).

### **6.0 HANDLING MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION**

#### **6.1 Identification & Logging**
*   Departments generating MNPI (e.g., Listing Team, Corporate Development, IT Security) must immediately classify it as such and notify the **Compliance Team**.
*   Compliance maintains a central **MNPI Log** recording the information, date identified, and personnel with access.

#### **6.2 Need-to-Know Principle**
*   MNPI must only be shared internally on a strict **need-to-know basis**. Discussions must be held in private, secure settings (e.g., encrypted channels, private meetings).

#### **6.3 Public Disclosure**
*   Only authorised spokespersons (CEO, CCO) may make public statements that could affect the market. Unauthorised disclosures via social media, forums, or to friends/family are strictly prohibited.

### **7.0 TRAINING, CERTIFICATION & MONITORING**
*   **Annual Training:** All Restricted Persons must complete certified Insider Trading and Market Conduct training.
*   **Quarterly Certification:** Covered Persons must submit a quarterly attestation confirming compliance with this policy, disclosure of all accounts, and reporting of any violations.
*   **Monitoring:** The Compliance Team conducts proactive monitoring of trading patterns, using both internal data and, where possible, external analysis tools to detect potential breaches.

---

### **8.0 VIOLATIONS & REPORTING**
*   **Reporting Obligation:** Employees must promptly report any suspected violations of this policy to the **CCO** or via the **Whistleblower hotline**.
*   **Consequences:** Violations constitute gross misconduct and will result in **immediate disciplinary action, up to and including termination**. CoinPort is obligated to report suspected illegal activity to ASIC and/or law enforcement, which may lead to criminal prosecution, significant fines, and imprisonment.
*   **No Safe Harbour:** The fact that CoinPort is not a listed company does not provide a safe harbour. Insider trading laws apply to all financial products, including Crypto Assets traded on any platform.
