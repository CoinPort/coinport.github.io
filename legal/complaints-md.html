  <h1>CoinPort Complaints Process</h1>

  <p>Customer service and satisfaction is important to us at CoinPort. We hope all our clients have a positive
    experience using CoinPort. Please contact us directly if you have any concerns or suggestions for improvement.
  </p>
  <p>Our complaint resolution process includes three steps to ensure issues can be resolved and reviewed quickly and comprehensively.</p>

  <h2>First Stage</h2>
  <p>In the first instance please contact our customer support team directly. Leave a request via email to support@coinport.com.au</p>

  <h2>Second Stage</h2>
  <p>If you are still not satisfied with the response from customer support, you may then contact our senior management at complaints@coinport.com.au.</p>
  <p>How long does it take? CoinPort is committed to resolving disputes and complaints in an expedient manner,
    however, it may not always be the case. Depending on the nature of the issue, normally this may take no more than 5 business days.</p>
  <p>If additional time is required, we will notify you accordingly. In circumstances where CoinPort requires further
    clarification or documentation from you in order to resolve the issue, the 5-business days will not commence until
    you have provided the CoinPort with the further clarification or documentation as required.</p>
    <p>If you are still not satisfied with the response from customer support, you may then contact our senior management at complaints@coinport.com.au</p>

  <h2>Third Stage</h2>
  <p>If you still feel that your complaint or dispute is not satisfactory resolved, the issue be raised with the Australian Financial Complaints Authority <a title="https://www.afca.org.au/" href="https://www.afca.org.au/" target="_blank">https://www.afca.org.au/</a> for a review.</p>
