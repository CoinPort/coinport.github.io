<b>History</b>
<p> Originally formed as a "joke", Dogecoin was created by IBM software engineer Billy Markus and Adobe software engineer Jackson Palmer. They wanted to create a peer-to-peer digital currency that could reach a broader demographic than
    billion. In July 2020, the price of Dogecoin spiked following a TikTok trend aiming to get the coin's price to $1.</p> 

<p>In January 2021, Dogecoin went up over 800% in 24 hours, attaining a price of $0.07, as a result of attention from Reddit users, partially encouraged by Elon Musk and the GameStop short squeeze. </p>
