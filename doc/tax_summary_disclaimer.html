﻿Disclaimer
General
This Taxation Summary Report (Report) has been produced for you on the basis that you:

are an Individual;
are an Australian resident for Australian tax purposes; and
have been undertaking digital asset activities on Coin Harbour as an Investor only, and is based on the details you entered when creating your Coin Harbour account.
If you are not an Australian resident for tax purposes, you may be a temporary resident or foreign resident and should seek professional advice regarding your liability to pay tax and comply with tax obligations in Australia with respect to your digital asset dealings through Coin Harbour.

This Report does not consider or calculate the tax implications of your digital asset activities that are characterised as carrying on a business of digital asset trading, as part of an isolated profit-making undertaking or scheme outside the ordinary course of your business, or as personal use or enjoyment.
Where an individual undertakes digital asset activities on other digital asset exchanges and/or blockchain networks, this Report is provided to assist customers of Coin Harbour in complying with their Australian tax reporting and record-keeping obligations but will not reflect all activity that would be reflected if the individual solely used Coin Harbour to undertake its digital asset activities
This Report is a guide only and is not a complete statement of the relevant tax law, nor does it take account of your individual circumstances (particularly digital asset activities you may have undertaken on other digital currency exchanges and/or directly via blockchain networks). Nothing in this Report should be considered as legal, accounting or tax advice. Accordingly, we recommend that you seek independent, professional tax advice about the tax implications of your digital asset activities in your specific circumstances.
This Report has been produced from advice from Mills Oakley, based on their interpretation of the Australian tax laws at 23 August 2021, including applicable case law, published private rulings by the ATO and published web guidance by the ATO, which may be subject to change with either retrospective or prospective impact. In particular, the ATO has published web guidance on the Tax treatment of digital assets in Australia specifically bitcoin, available at this link: https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Gen/Tax-treatment-of-crypto-currencies-in-Australia---specifically-bitcoin/. The ATO's web guidance is provided merely for reference purposes only and with emphasis that the web guidance is not binding on the ATO. The Australian tax treatment of a digital asset is subject to some uncertainty as digital assets is a relatively new asset class and many tax concepts as applied to digital asset activities remain untested.
All amounts prefaced with a “$” are denominated in Australian dollars.
Other than where you have been prompted to enter information on the Coin Harbour website, this Report does not consider the impact of your non-Coin Harbour digital asset activities, nor does it calculate the tax implications for digital asset activities you undertake on other digital currency exchanges and/or blockchain networks.
Your self-assessed tax characterisation as an Investor may not be accurate if you have undertaken digital asset activities on other digital currency exchanges and/or directly via blockchain networks. You are responsible for verifying the accuracy of your tax characterisation as an Investor, as well as keeping appropriate records to accurately determine your Australian tax position and comply with your tax obligations each income year. Accordingly, we recommend that you provide this Report to your registered tax agent who can advise you as to the appropriate use of the information contained in this Report in preparing your Individual Tax Return and meeting your tax obligations.
It is possible for a Trader to hold a portion of their digital assets as investments; and likewise, for an Investor to use a portion of their digital assets as trading stock. In such cases, accurate and contemporaneous record keeping is essential to demonstrate that a split portfolio is being maintained. Taxing events are applicable when a CGT asset you hold starts to become an item of trading stock and vice versa and the tax treatment of digital asset activities of an Investor differs to the tax treatment of digital asset activities of a Trader.
Tax assumptions regarding Coin Harbour transactions
A number of assumptions have been made regarding how each type of Coin Harbour transaction is treated for Australian tax purposes in generating this Report. Where possible, the assumptions are based on applicable case law principles and published web guidance by the ATO, which may be subject to change with either retrospective or prospective impact. In some case, no guidance is available, and a pragmatic view has been taken

The assumptions are as follows:

Deposit of Australian dollars
The deposit of Australian dollars in your Coin Harbour account is not treated as a taxing event. As such, no CGT cost base is set in relation to the deposit of Australian dollars in your Coin Harbour account.

Deposit of a digital asset (Transfers In)
By default, Coin Harbour sets the CGT cost base of a digital asset transferred into your Coin Harbour wallet at the market rate (as per Coin Harbour exchange rates) at the time of receipt by Coin Harbour and the date of acquisition of a digital asset as the date of receipt by Coin Harbour. Your actual CGT cost base and original date of acquisition will most likely be different.

Acquisition of a digital asset with Australian dollars
The Australian dollar amount paid to acquire a digital asset will be treated as the CGT cost base of your digital asset.

Coin Harbour Maker and Taker fees charged on acquisition will be added to the CGT cost base of your digital asset.

Acquisition of digital assets with other digital assets
The acquisition of a digital asset (second digital asset) with another digital asset (first digital asset) is treated as a disposal of the first digital asset and an acquisition of the second digital asset.

The disposal of a digital asset is a CGT event, which requires you to work out whether a capital gain or capital loss has been made. A capital gain arises if capital proceeds received are greater than the CGT cost base of the digital asset. A capital loss arises if capital proceeds received are less than the reduced CGT cost base of the digital asset.

The Australian dollar value of the first digital asset at the time of the transaction is treated as the amount of capital proceeds received when working out whether you have made a capital gain or capital loss. All digital assets listed on Coin Harbour are supported by an Australian dollar trading pair. As such, the Coin Harbour Australian dollar trading pair exchange rate for the first digital asset will be automatically applied to calculate the capital proceeds received on disposal of the first digital asset.

The Australian dollar value of Coin Harbour Maker and Taker fees charged on disposal will be added to the CGT cost base of your digital asset. Maker and Taker fees for digital asset to digital asset transactions are charged in the first digital asset. As such, the Coin Harbour Australian dollar trading pair exchange rate for the first digital asset will be automatically applied to calculate the Australian dollar value of fees charged.

For each disposal of a digital asset, you can select the CGT calculation method as either: FIFO (first-in first-out) or LIFO (last-in first-out).

The CGT cost base for the second digital asset will be recorded as equal to the Australian dollar amount of capital proceeds received for the first digital asset.

Disposal of a digital asset for Australian dollars
The disposal of a digital asset is a CGT event, which requires you to work out whether a capital gain or capital loss has been made. A capital gain arises if capital proceeds received are greater than the CGT cost base of the digital asset. A capital loss arises if capital proceeds received are less than the reduced CGT cost base of the digital asset.

The Australian dollar amount received on disposal of a digital asset is treated as the amount of capital proceeds received when working out whether you have made a capital gain or capital loss.

Coin Harbour Maker and Taker fees charged on disposal will be added to the CGT cost base of your digital asset. Maker and Taker fees are charged in the digital asset that is being disposed of. As such, the Coin Harbour Australian dollar trading pair exchange rate for the digital asset will be automatically applied to calculate the Australian dollar value of fees charged.

For each disposal of a digital asset, you are able to select the CGT calculation method as either: FIFO (first-in first-out) or LIFO (last-in first-out).

Withdrawal of Australian dollars
The withdrawal of Australian dollars from your Coin Harbour account is not treated as a taxing event and no CGT consequences should arise in relation to the withdrawal of Australian dollars from your Coin Harbour account.

Withdrawal of a digital asset (Transfers Out)
The withdrawal of a digital asset from your Coin Harbour wallet to an external wallet is not treated as a taxing event.

Coin Harbour assumes that you are not registered for GST or required to be registered for GST. As such, the GST inclusive amount of Coin Harbour Maker and Taker fees is included in the CGT cost base of your digital asset.
Coin Harbour assumes that all digital assets listed on Coin Harbour meet the definition of 'digital currency' for GST purposes, or otherwise should be treated as GST-free financial supplies. As such, the disposal of digital assets on Coin Harbour should be treated as equivalent to money and should not give rise to GST consequences with respect to the digital asset supplied (noting that GST is applicable to the Coin Harbour Maker and Taker fees). The GST definition of 'digital currency' is relatively new and subject to some uncertainty. To the extent that the ATO considers that GST applies to the underlying supply of a digital asset disposed of on Coin Harbour, then you are liable to pay any amount of GST (and applicable interest and penalties) applicable to the ATO. Coin Harbour will not be responsible for GST for which you may be liable to collect and remit to the ATO. Accordingly, we recommend that you seek independent, professional tax advice specific to your circumstances.
Hard Forks (sometimes referred to as Chain Splits)
Under current ATO web guidance, a taxpayer that receives new digital assets from a Chain Split event does not derive ordinary income or a capital gain as a result of receiving the new digital asset, the new digital asset has a CGT cost base of zero and the original digital asset retains its original CGT cost base. The tax treatment of Hard Forks is a complex area of the law and overseas authorities (e.g. Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs in the United Kingdom) have differing views on the tax treatment of Hard Forks.
This Report adopts a tax treatment of Hard Forks that aligns with the current ATO web guidance, such that no gain will be calculated on the deposit of the new digital asset into your Coin Harbour wallet and a CGT cost base of zero will be recorded for the new digital asset. The date of acquisition of the new digital asset will be treated as the date the new digital asset is deposited into your Coin Harbour wallet.
Where you hold a digital asset in your Coin Harbour wallet just before the Hard Fork, you will receive the new digital asset into a Coin Harbour wallet that you control if, after Coin Harbour has reviewed the new digital asset, Coin Harbour decides to list and support trading of the new digital asset on Coin Harbour.
Airdrops

Under current non-binding ATO web guidance, a taxpayer that receives a digital asset as an airdrop should include the Australian dollar value of the digital asset at the time the airdropped digital asset is received in their assessable income. The cost base of airdropped digital assets is also set at the market value of the digital asset at the time received. The ATO web guidance uses the language that 'The money value of an established token received through an airdrop is ordinary income of the recipient at the time it is derived'.
This Report adopts a tax treatment of airdrops that aligns with the current ATO web guidance outlined above, such that airdrops will only be permitted for cryptocurrencies that are already listed on Coin Harbour and Coin Harbour will record the market value of the digital asset at the time it is received into your Coin Harbour wallet. However, not all airdrops are the same and you are responsible for seeking independent, professional advice about your circumstances.

No Responsibility
Coin Harbour does not warrant or otherwise guarantee the accuracy or completeness of assumptions made regarding how each type of Coin Harbour transaction is treated for Australian tax purposes or the accuracy or completeness of amounts produced in this Report and do not accept liability for any loss arising from using this Report. Accordingly, we recommend that you seek independent professional advice regarding your use of this Report.
Coin Harbour do not accept any responsibility for verifying the accuracy of information about digital asset activities you have undertaken on other digital currency exchanges and/or blockchain networks that you choose to enter into outside of Coin Harbour.
Whilst every effort has been made to ensure the assumptions and calculations underlying this Report are correct, Coin Harbour accepts no liability for errors or omissions in assumptions or calculated figures. We reserve the right to remedy any errors or omissions that may be present in this Report. If you find an error or omission in this Report, please advise us immediately.
