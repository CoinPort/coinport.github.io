**Title: Crypto Wallets Explained – Exchange vs. Metamask vs. Ledger with Leonie Green**  

**[Opening Scene: Animated Leonie Green standing in front of three floating wallet icons: an exchange logo (e.g., CoinPort), a Metamask fox, and a Ledger device.]**  

**Leonie Green (Friendly & Clear):**  
*"G’day, I’m Leonie Green from CoinPort! Storing crypto safely starts with choosing the right wallet. But what’s the difference between keeping coins on an exchange like CoinPort, using a software wallet like Metamask, or a hardware device like Ledger? Let’s break it down!"*

### **1️⃣ Centralized Exchange Wallets (e.g., CoinPort, Binance)**  
**[Scene: A bank vault with a "CoinPort" sign, where Leonie gestures to deposits inside.]**  

**Leonie:**  
*"When you buy crypto on an exchange like CoinPort, your coins are held in the exchange’s wallet—kind of like keeping cash in a bank. It’s convenient for trading, but there’s a catch..."*  

✔ **Pros:**  
- Easy for beginners (no private keys to manage).  
- Fast trades & built-in security features.  

✖ **Cons:**  
- **Not your keys, not your crypto!** If the exchange gets hacked (like FTX), you could lose funds.  
- Withdrawal limits or freezes possible.  

*"Great for active traders, but risky for long-term storage!"*

### **2️⃣ Self-Custody Wallets (e.g., Metamask, Trust Wallet)**  
**[Scene: A digital wallet (Metamask fox) floating above a phone, with Leonie holding a "Private Key" keychain.]**  

**Leonie:**  
*"Software wallets like Metamask or Trust Wallet put YOU in control. You manage your private keys—the passwords to your crypto—stored securely on your device."*  

✔ **Pros:**  
- **True ownership** – No third party can freeze your assets.  
- Connects to DeFi, NFTs, and dApps easily.  

✖ **Cons:**  
- If you lose your seed phrase, funds are gone forever.  
- Phone/computer hackers could target your wallet.  

*"Ideal for daily use, but you MUST back up your seed phrase!"*  

---  

### **3️⃣ Hardware Wallets (e.g., Ledger, Trezor)**  
**[Scene: A Ledger Nano X floating in space, with a "Hacker Shield" force field around it.]**  

**Leonie:**  
*"Hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor are the Fort Knox of crypto! They store keys offline, away from hackers—even if you plug into a malware-infected computer."*  

✔ **Pros:**  
- **Ultra-secure** – Immune to online attacks.  
- Works with Metamask for safe DeFi access.  

✖ **Cons:**  
- Costs money (usually $50–$200).  
- Less convenient for quick trades.  

*"Best for long-term ‘HODLers’ or large amounts!"*
