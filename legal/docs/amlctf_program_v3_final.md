# INTRODUCTION

## 1. ABOUT THE AML/CTF ACT

1.1 The Anti-Money Laundering ("AML") and Counter-Terrorism Financing ("CTF") Act 2006 ("AML/CTF Act") and the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Rules 2025 ("Rules") broad purpose is to regulate financial transactions in a way that will help identify, mitigate and manage money laundering and terrorism financing risks.

1.2 The AML/CTF Act provides general principles and obligations while detailed operating rules are covered in rules made by the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre ("AUSTRAC"). AUSTRAC is the government agency responsible for administering the AML/CTF Act.

1.3 The AML/CTF Act applies to persons who provide specified services (known as "designated services"). Persons providing designated services are called "reporting entities".

1.4 CoinPort Pty Ltd ("CoinPort") provides one or more designated services listed in the AML/CTF Act and is therefore a reporting entity. These services are included in the AML/CTF Act because they are vulnerable to abuse by criminals for money laundering or terrorism financing purposes.

1.5 The AML/CTF Act adopts a risk-based approach. This approach means that the reporting entity decides how best to identify, mitigate and manage the risk of money laundering and terrorism financing through its business. Reporting entities therefore need to undertake a comprehensive assessment of these risks relative to their businesses.

## 2. ADOPTION

2.1 CoinPort adopts this unified Program as its AML/CTF Program ("Program") for the purposes of the AML/CTF Act. On and from 5 January 2026, CoinPort must comply with the Program, as varied from time to time.

2.2 This unified Program replaces the previous Part A and Part B structure in accordance with the 2026 AML/CTF reforms, which abolished the requirement to maintain separate program components.

2.3 From 31 March 2026, CoinPort's registration designation changes from "Digital Currency Exchange (DCE)" to "Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP)" to align with international Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards. This terminology change reflects the expanded scope of regulated virtual asset services.

| VERSION | DATE | NOTES |
|---------|------|-------|
| 1.0 | 6 June 2021 | Original Part A and Part B prepared |
| 2.0 | 1 July 2024 | Edits for fraud prevention |
| 3.0 | 5 January 2026 | Unified program for 2026 compliance including Travel Rule; DCE→VASP terminology transition |

## 2A. 2026 REFORMS: COINPORT'S RISK-BASED APPROACH

### 2A.1 Overview of 2026 Regulatory Changes

The 2026 AML/CTF reforms represent a fundamental shift from prescriptive, rules-based compliance to an **outcomes-focused, risk-based approach**. CoinPort's Program is designed to demonstrate effective management of money laundering, terrorism financing, and proliferation financing risks specific to our business operations, rather than simply meeting checklist requirements.

### 2A.2 Key Reforms Affecting CoinPort

**From Prescriptive to Outcomes-Based:**
- Previous framework: Detailed Part A/Part B requirements with prescribed procedures
- New framework: Unified program demonstrating effective risk management outcomes
- Focus: What CoinPort achieves in managing ML/TF/PF risks, not just what procedures we follow

**Proliferation Financing Added:**
CoinPort must now identify, assess, and mitigate risks related to **Proliferation Financing (PF)** - the financing of weapons of mass destruction - alongside money laundering (ML) and terrorism financing (TF). All references to "ML/TF" in this Program are understood to include PF.

**Mandatory Risk Assessments:**
Risk assessments are no longer "best practice" but an **explicit legal obligation**. CoinPort must:
- Conduct comprehensive ML/TF/PF risk assessments across all business activities
- Update risk assessments following any "adverse event" or significant business change
- Document risk assessment methodology and findings
- Demonstrate how controls are proportionate to identified risks

**Dynamic Program Updates:**
Programs must be updated following:
- Any adverse event (regulatory action, significant breach, fraud incident)
- Material changes to business model or services
- Entry into new markets or jurisdictions
- Introduction of new products or delivery channels
- Identification of new or emerging ML/TF/PF risks

### 2A.3 CoinPort's Specific Risk Profile

CoinPort has assessed its ML/TF/PF risk profile based on our specific business characteristics:

**Services Provided:**
- Buying, selling, exchanging, and custody of virtual assets
- Focus on major cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins)
- Retail-focused digital currency exchange operations

**Customer Types (Risk Level: LOW to HIGH):**
- **Individual retail customers** - Standard retail cryptocurrency users
- **Companies and corporate entities** - Australian and foreign companies requiring beneficial ownership verification
- **Self-Managed Super Funds (SMSFs)** - Pension and retirement investment vehicles
- **Trusts** - Including family trusts, unit trusts, and discretionary trusts
- **Partnerships** - Business partnerships and joint ventures
- **Institutional clients** - Superannuation funds, corporate treasury operations
- This diverse customer base requires comprehensive KYC procedures across all entity types (Sections 34-42)
- Enhanced fraud prevention for vulnerable customers (55+ age verification for individuals)

**Delivery Channels (Risk Level: MEDIUM):**
- Non-face-to-face onboarding (inherent higher risk, mitigated by robust KYC)
- Digital platform with instant payment capabilities (Monoova OSKO/PayID integration)
- Blockchain-based transfers (traceability via AMLBot blockchain analytics and sanctions screening)
- Real-time wallet address screening for sanctioned entities, blacklisted exchanges, and high-risk counterparties

**Jurisdictions (Risk Level: LOW to MEDIUM):**
- Primary operations: Australia (lower risk, robust AML/CTF framework)
- Secondary focus: Remittance corridors to FATF-compliant jurisdictions
- Sanctions screening against all high-risk jurisdictions
- No business in sanctioned or non-cooperative jurisdictions

**Proliferation Financing Risk Assessment:**
CoinPort's PF risk is assessed as **LOW-MEDIUM** due to:
- Diverse customer base including corporate entities (increased complexity vs individual-only model)
- Enhanced beneficial ownership verification for all corporate structures
- Comprehensive sanctions screening including proliferation-related sanctions
- Transaction monitoring for unusual patterns that could indicate PF activity
- No trade finance or dual-use goods transactions (reduces risk)
- No business relationships with entities in jurisdictions of PF concern

### 2A.4 CoinPort's Risk-Based Controls

**Proportionate Customer Due Diligence:**

CoinPort applies **three tiers of CDD** based on customer risk:

| Risk Level | Criteria | CDD Approach |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| **Simplified CDD** | ASX-listed companies, APRA-regulated institutions, majority-owned subsidiaries of listed companies, licensed and regulated entities | Simplified verification procedures per Section 35(i), reduced beneficial ownership requirements, annual reviews |
| **Standard CDD** | Individual retail customers, Australian standard companies, SMSFs, standard partnerships, simple trusts | Standard KYC verification, annual reviews, automated transaction monitoring |
| **Enhanced CDD** | PEPs, high transaction volumes (>$50k/month), cross-border remittances, complex corporate structures, offshore entities, trusts with multiple layers, self-employed with complex income, adverse media hits | Additional source of funds/wealth verification, senior management approval, semi-annual reviews, enhanced monitoring, beneficial ownership to ultimate individual level |

**Digital Verification Embraced:**
- CoinPort utilizes electronic identity verification through approved KYC providers (KYC-AID and Sumsub)
- Liveness detection and document verification technology
- No requirement to maintain physical certified copies in most cases
- Blockchain analytics for transaction verification via AMLBot
- AMLBot real-time screening for sanctioned wallet addresses, blacklisted exchanges, and high-risk counterparties
- Real-time sanctions screening at customer onboarding and daily thereafter

**Risk-Triggered Enhanced Due Diligence:**
Enhanced CDD is automatically triggered when:
- Customer identified as PEP (domestic, foreign, or international organization)
- Monthly transaction volume exceeds $50,000 AUD
- Complex corporate structure with multiple layers of ownership
- Offshore corporate entities or trusts in secrecy jurisdictions
- Beneficial owners cannot be clearly identified to ultimate individual level
- Company or trust with no clear commercial purpose
- AMLBot blockchain analytics flag high-risk wallet interactions (sanctioned addresses, blacklisted exchanges, mixers)
- Customer based in or transacting with higher-risk jurisdictions
- Unusual transaction patterns detected
- Source of funds unclear or inconsistent with customer profile
- Travel Rule information incomplete or suspicious (from March 2026)
- Cash-intensive business operations
- Significant changes in company ownership or control structure
- AMLBot detects connections to darknet markets, ransomware, or theft
- Deposits from exchanges flagged as non-compliant by AMLBot

### 2A.5 Strengthened Governance & Oversight (2026 Requirements)

**Management Accountability:**
Senior management must take "reasonable steps" to ensure CoinPort complies with this Program. This includes:
- Regular review of compliance metrics and risk indicators
- Timely response to identified deficiencies
- Adequate resourcing of compliance functions
- Setting appropriate "tone from the top" regarding compliance culture

**Compliance Officer Authority:**
The AML/CTF Compliance Officer (Nicanor Nuqui) is:
- At management level with direct Board reporting
- Empowered to make compliance decisions independently

- Accountable for reporting compliance status to the Governing Body

**Governing Body Oversight:**
CoinPort's Board receives:
- Monthly compliance reports covering SMRs, risk incidents, and Program effectiveness
- Quarterly risk assessment summaries
- Annual independent review findings
- Immediate notification of adverse events or regulatory contact
- Regular training on ML/TF/PF risks and obligations

### 2A.6 Reporting Groups (Replacing Designated Business Groups)

**Current Status:** CoinPort operates as a single entity and is not part of a Reporting Group.

**If CoinPort Forms a Reporting Group:**
- CoinPort would appoint a Lead Entity responsible for group-wide compliance
- Lead Entity would coordinate risk assessments across the group
- Enhanced information sharing permitted within the group (subject to updated tipping-off rules)
- Collective risk management approach while maintaining individual entity accountability
- Refer to Section 6 for Reporting Group procedures

2. Assesses impact on risk assessment and Program adequacy
3. Implements corrective actions within defined timeframes
4. Updates this Program if systematic issues identified
5. Reports to Board with remediation plan
6. Conducts follow-up testing to verify effectiveness

### 2A.9 CoinPort's Commitment to Risk-Based Compliance

CoinPort commits to:
- **Proportionate controls:** Resources allocated based on actual risk, not arbitrary rules
- **Flexibility:** Adapting procedures as risks evolve and business changes
- **Effectiveness over compliance:** Focus on preventing ML/TF/PF, not just ticking boxes
- **Transparency:** Clear documentation of risk decisions and rationale
- **Continuous improvement:** Learning from incidents, near-misses, and industry developments
- **Regulatory engagement:** Proactive communication with AUSTRAC on risk management approach

This risk-based approach allows CoinPort to:
- Focus resources on highest-risk areas (enhanced monitoring of PEPs, large transactions, cross-border transfers)
- Streamline processes for low-risk customers (standard retail individuals)
- Respond quickly to emerging threats (new ML/TF/PF typologies, sanctions developments)
- Demonstrate compliance through outcomes, not just documentation
- Maintain business efficiency while managing risk effectively

# MONEY LAUNDERING AND TERRORISM FINANCING

## 13. WHAT IS MONEY LAUNDERING?

13.1 Money laundering ("ML") is the process used to disguise the illegal origin of the proceeds of illegal activities such as drugs trafficking, tax evasion, smuggling, theft, terrorism, arms trafficking and corrupt practices.

13.2 There are three main stages of ML:
- (a) **Placement** – the physical disposal of the proceeds e.g. deposit into an account;
- (b) **Layering** – creating complex layers of financial transactions to separate the proceeds from their source and hide any audit trail;
- (c) **Integration** – taking the proceeds of ML and placing them back into the financial system so they appear legitimate.

## 14. WHAT IS TERRORISM FINANCING?

14.1 Terrorism financing ("TF") is often the reverse of ML whereby funds within a legitimate source are put into the financial system and redirected into the hands of terrorist organisations.

14.2 Terrorist organisations obtain money from:
- (a) Illegal Activities – drug trafficking, smuggling, kidnapping and extortion;
- (b) Rich Individuals;
- (c) Charitable and Religious Institutions;
- (d) Commercial Enterprises; and
- (e) State Sponsors.

## 14A. WHAT IS PROLIFERATION FINANCING?

14A.1 Proliferation financing ("PF") is the act of providing funds or financial services which are used, in whole or in part, for the manufacture, acquisition, possession, development, export, trans-shipment, brokering, transport, transfer, stockpiling or use of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons and their means of delivery and related materials (including both technologies and dual-use goods used for non-legitimate purposes), in contravention of national laws or, where applicable, international obligations.

14A.2 In simpler terms, PF is financing weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs, including the networks and entities that support them.

14A.3 Proliferation financing activities may involve:
- (a) Front companies and shell corporations used to obscure the true purpose of transactions;
- (b) Trade in dual-use goods (items with both civilian and military applications) such as certain chemicals, metals, or technology components;
- (c) Financial transactions with entities in jurisdictions of proliferation concern (particularly North Korea and Iran);
- (d) Complex corporate structures designed to evade sanctions targeting WMD programs;
- (e) Use of financial systems to move funds for procurement of WMD-related materials;
- (f) Sanctions evasion techniques to access the international financial system despite targeted restrictions.

14A.4 Key differences between ML/TF and PF:
- **Money Laundering (ML):** Disguising illegal funds to make them appear legitimate
- **Terrorism Financing (TF):** Moving funds (legal or illegal) to terrorist organizations
- **Proliferation Financing (PF):** Moving funds or providing financial services to support WMD programs, often involving state actors and complex international trade networks

14A.5 PF was added as a mandatory risk consideration under the 2026 AML/CTF reforms, requiring CoinPort to:
- (a) Identify and assess PF risks specific to our business;
- (b) Screen against proliferation-related sanctions lists (UN, DFAT, OFAC);
- (c) Monitor for PF red flags including complex corporate structures that could be used for sanctions evasion;
- (d) Report suspicious matters that may relate to PF activities.

14A.6 CoinPort's PF risk profile is assessed as LOW-MEDIUM. See Appendix 3 Section 5 for detailed PF risk assessment and Section 26.2 for PF-specific sanctions controls.

## 22. SUSPICIOUS MATTER REPORTING

22.1 CoinPort adopts a 'Red Flag' policy which requires employees to complete a Red Flag Indicator Sheet (Appendix 2) for each new client and as a procedure to conduct ongoing transaction monitoring.

### General Rules

CoinPort must submit a SMR to AUSTRAC if:
- (a) CoinPort commences to provide, or proposes to provide, a designated service to a person; or
- (b) a person requests CoinPort provides a designated service; or
- (c) a person makes an enquiry about whether CoinPort would be willing to provide a designated service;

and CoinPort forms a suspicion on reasonable grounds that:
- (a) a person (or their agent) is not the person they claim to be, or
- (b) information CoinPort has may be:
  - (i) relevant to the investigation or prosecution of a person for an offence against a law;
  - (ii) relevant to the investigation or prosecution of an evasion or attempted evasion of a taxation law;
  - (iii) relevant to a ML/TF offence;
  - (iv) of assistance in the enforcement of laws relating to proceeds of crime; or
- (c) providing a designated service may be:
  - (i) preparatory to committing an offence related to ML or TF, or
  - (ii) relevant to the investigation or prosecution of a person for an offence related to ML or TF.

### Who is Covered?

Existing, new or potential customers, or an agent of an existing, new or potential customer.

### When to Report?

CoinPort must report a matter to AUSTRAC if a reasonable person would conclude from all circumstances and information available that an SMR must be submitted.

CoinPort's employees and AML/CTF CO are NOT expected to know or establish:
- (a) the exact nature of any criminal offence the customer may be involved in, or
- (b) that particular funds or property have been acquired through illicit means.

### Red Flag Policy

CoinPort adopts a 'Red Flag' policy which requires employees to complete the Red Flag Indicators Sheet (Appendix 2).

**Red Flag Indicators**: CoinPort develops a list of Red Flag Indicators (Appendix 2). This sheet is updated on an ongoing basis.

CoinPort requires Appendix 2 to be completed:
- (a) for each new client – before the provision of a designated service; and
- (b) for existing clients – on a half yearly basis or whenever the AML/CTF CO considers necessary.

### Reporting Line

**Existence of 1 Red Flag:**

Employee → Immediate Supervisor → AML/CTF CO → AUSTRAC

The employee responsible should:
- (a) conduct enhanced due diligence procedures and refer to immediate supervisor – the employee must not discuss the matter with anyone else except supervisor or AML/CTF CO;
- (b) the supervisor will report to AML/CTF CO once results of enhanced due diligence are received; and
- (c) the AML/CTF CO will then make an assessment on whether an SMR is required.

### Suspicion Relating to Identity of Customer

If the AML/CTF CO is notified of a suspicion relating to the identity of the customer, the AML/CTF CO must, within fourteen (14) days, do one of the following:
- (a) review all KYC information in respect of the customer;
- (b) re-verify, from a reliable and independent source, any KYC Information obtained;
- (c) verify, from a reliable and independent source, any previously unverified KYC Information.

If after reviewing enhanced due diligence information the AML/CTF CO is still not satisfied that the customer is who they claim to be, or is unable to collect additional information, then the AML/CTF CO must make a SMR to AUSTRAC.

### Suspicion Relating to Existing Customer

If the AML/CTF CO forms a reasonable suspicion in respect of an existing customer, the AML/CTF CO must, within fourteen (14) days, carry out the applicable customer identification procedures.

### Discussion or Communication About the SMR

**Immediate Supervisor or AML/CTF CO**: CoinPort's employees must ONLY discuss the matter with their immediate supervisor, or the AML/CTF CO when their supervisor is not available, unless otherwise authorised.

After forming an initial suspicion, the employee should use discretion when making further enquiries to minimise the risk of the customer realising an SMR has been submitted.

**AUSTRAC CEO**: Once CoinPort has fulfilled the obligation to provide relevant information about a suspicious matter to AUSTRAC CEO, CoinPort's employees must not disclose to anyone other than AUSTRAC CEO or AUSTRAC staff that the information has been communicated.

### Submitting an SMR

If CoinPort's AML/CTF CO receives notification of a suspicious matter, the AML/CTF CO must:
- (a) assess the information which led the employee to form a suspicion; and
- (b) determine whether a SMR should be lodged.

If the AML/CTF CO determines that a SMR must be lodged, CoinPort will:
- (a) keep all records of results of any enhanced customer due diligence conducted; and
- (b) report the suspicion to AUSTRAC CEO through submitting an SMR in an approved form:
  - (i) within twenty-four (24) hours after forming the suspicion, if the matter relates to TF; or
  - (ii) in all other cases, within three (3) business days after forming the suspicion;
- (c) consult with AUSTRAC and other relevant enforcement agencies to determine how best to deal with the customer, if required; and
- (d) continue to transact with the customer on the usual basis until further advised.

### Can CoinPort Continue Providing Services?

The AML/CTF Act does not direct reporting entities to stop providing designated services to, or terminate a business relationship with, a customer, even if CoinPort has formed a suspicion about that particular customer.

The AML/CTF CO will, after submitting an SMR, make an assessment as to whether to continue transacting with the customer. If CoinPort decides to continue the business relationship:
- (a) CoinPort must not disclose to the customer that it has formed a suspicion and/or communicated the suspicion to AUSTRAC – this is "tipping off"; and
- (b) CoinPort must continue to comply with the AML/CTF Act in all future dealings, which may include submitting additional SMRs.

### Tipping Off Provisions

CoinPort must NOT disclose to any person (other than AUSTRAC) that it formed a suspicion about a customer or that it submitted an SMR to AUSTRAC. Doing so would constitute 'tipping off', which is an offence prohibited by section 123 of AML/CTF Act.

Reporting Entities that submit SMRs also have additional obligations not to disclose any:
- (a) information that might reasonably lead a person to conclude that they formed a suspicion about a customer or communicated that suspicion to AUSTRAC; and
- (b) requests from AUSTRAC for further information about an SMR report.

AUSTRAC considers that simply asking a customer for additional information (for example, about their identity or the source of funds) would not constitute an unlawful disclosure or tipping off offence.

### Permitted Information Sharing (2025 Harm-Based Test)

**2025 Reform - Harm-Based Tipping Off Test:**

Under the updated tipping-off provisions effective from 2025, CoinPort may share information in certain circumstances where it does not prejudice an investigation or pose a risk of harm. Specifically:

**Within a Reporting Group:**
- If CoinPort is part of a Reporting Group (see Section 6), information may be shared between group members for the purpose of managing ML/TF/PF risks
- Information sharing must be documented and have a legitimate risk management purpose
- Must not be shared with the customer or in circumstances where it could reasonably tip off the customer
- Group members bound by same tipping-off obligations

**With Professional Advisors:**
- Information may be shared with legal practitioners to obtain legal advice on AML/CTF obligations
- Information may be shared with external auditors conducting independent reviews of this Program
- Information may be shared with compliance consultants assisting with risk assessments

**With Other Regulated Entities:**
- Limited information sharing permitted where necessary to manage ML/TF/PF risks
- Must not result in customer being tipped off about SMR or investigation
- Applies the "harm-based test": sharing is permitted if it would not prejudice an investigation or enforcement action

**Harm-Based Test Application:**
Before sharing any SMR-related information, the AML/CTF CO must assess:
1. Is the sharing necessary for a legitimate compliance or risk management purpose?
2. Would the sharing reasonably be expected to prejudice an AUSTRAC investigation or enforcement action?
3. Could the sharing result in the customer becoming aware that an SMR was filed?
4. Is the recipient bound by similar confidentiality obligations?

If sharing would likely prejudice an investigation or tip off the customer, it must not occur.

**Documentation Required:**
- All instances of permitted information sharing must be documented
- Rationale for sharing and harm-based test assessment must be recorded
- Recipient of information must be identified
- Date and nature of information shared must be logged

There are exemptions under the AML/CTF Act for the tipping off provisions which includes when CoinPort communicates a suspicion to a legal practitioner to obtain legal advice.

## 24. TRANSACTION REPORTING - INTERNATIONAL VALUE TRANSFER SERVICE (IVTS)

24.1 Under the AML/CTF Act, if a Reporting Entity sends or receives an instruction to or from a foreign country for a transfer of value (including money, property, or virtual assets), they must submit an International Value Transfer Service ("IVTS") report to AUSTRAC.

24.2 The IVTS report must be in the approved form and sent in accordance with the requirements of the AML Rules.

### IVTS Reporting

**Rules**: Under the AML/CTF Act, if a Reporting Entity sends or receives an instruction to or from a foreign country for a transfer of value under a value transfer arrangement, they must submit an IVTS report to AUSTRAC. The reporting obligations for IVTS are set out in section 45 and 46 of the AML/CTF Act.

**IVTS**: An electronic value transfer instruction is an electronic instruction sent between an ordering institution and a beneficiary institution. An International value transfer instruction occurs when:
- the ordering institution accepts the instruction at or through a permanent establishment in Australia and the transferred value is made available to the payee at or through a permanent establishment of the beneficiary institution in a foreign country (an outgoing IVTS); or
- the ordering institution accepts the instructions at or through a permanent establishment in a foreign country and the value is transferred to a permanent establishment of the receiving institution in Australia (an incoming IVTS).

There are two (2) types of IVTS:
- (a) IVTS (outgoing): Instructions transmitted out of Australia.
- (b) IVTS (incoming): Instructions transmitted into Australia.

### CoinPort's Process

(a) When an employee receives an IVTS from a customer, they must refer this instruction immediately to their supervisor;
(b) The supervisor will report to the AML/CTF CO on a daily basis on all IVTS; and
(c) The AML/CTF CO must submit an IVTS report in an approved form to AUSTRAC CEO within ten (10) business days of the transaction taking place.

### Information Required for an IVTS (Outgoing)

**Minimum Information Required:**
- (a) CoinPort must complete all required elements of the relevant form or spreadsheet via AUSTRAC Online.
- (b) Complete payer information pursuant to section 16.2(1) of the Rules.
- (c) Complete tracing information pursuant to section 16.2(2) of the Rules.

**Complete Payer Information:**
- (a) The name of the payer;
- (b) One of the following:
  - (i) the payer's full business or residential address (not a post office box);
  - (ii) a unique identification number given to the payer by the Commonwealth or an authority (e.g.: ABN or ACN);

  - (v) if the payer is an individual—the payer's date of birth, the country of birth and the town, city or locality of birth; and
- (c) If the money is, or is to be, transferred from a single account held by the payer with the ordering institution in Australia—the account number or a unique reference number for the transfer instruction.

**Complete Tracing Information:**
- (a) If the money is to be transferred from an account held by the payer with the ordering institution—the account number; or
- (b) In any case—a unique reference number for the transfer instruction.

### Information Required for an IVTS (Incoming)

**Minimum Information Required:**
- (a) CoinPort must complete all required elements of the relevant form or spreadsheet via AUSTRAC Online.
- (b) Complete payer information pursuant to section 16.3(3)(a) of the Rules.

## 25. TRAVEL RULE COMPLIANCE (2026 REQUIREMENTS)

### 25.1 Travel Rule Overview

Effective 31 March 2026, CoinPort must collect, verify, and transmit originator and beneficiary information for all cryptocurrency transfers between Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), regardless of transaction value.

**CRITICAL: Australia has NO minimum threshold for VASP-to-VASP transfers. The Travel Rule applies to all virtual asset transfers between VASPs.**

### 25.2 Information Collection Requirements

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION - The $10,000 Threshold:**

The AUD $10,000 threshold applies to **AUSTRAC reporting for self-hosted wallets**, NOT to the Travel Rule data collection obligations. There are three distinct scenarios:

---

#### **Scenario 1: VASP-to-VASP Transfers (Exchange to Exchange)**

**NO MINIMUM THRESHOLD - Travel Rule Applies to ALL Amounts**

*Originator Information (must collect and verify):*
- Full legal name
- Account number or unique transaction identifier
- Physical address (residential or business)
- Date and place of birth OR customer ID number

*Beneficiary Information (must collect):*
- Full legal name or registered business name
- Account number or wallet address
- Physical address (if available)

**This applies whether the transfer is $1 or $1,000,000 AUD.**

---

#### **Scenario 2: VASP-to-Self-Hosted Wallet (Exchange to Private Wallet)**

**Travel Rule Does NOT Apply** (there is no other VASP to exchange information with)

However, CoinPort has **TWO separate duties:**

**Duty 1: Internal Collection Duty (ALL Amounts - No Threshold)**
- CoinPort must collect and verify originator and beneficiary information for **its own records**
- Applies to transfers of ANY amount (e.g., $50, $500, $5,000, $50,000)
- Minimum information to collect:
  - Originator: Customer's verified identity (already on file)
  - Beneficiary: Name and wallet address
  - Customer attestation of wallet ownership (encouraged)
  - AMLBot blockchain analytics screening of destination wallet

**Duty 2: AUSTRAC Reporting Obligation (≥ AUD $10,000 Threshold)**

(a) **Unverified Self-Hosted Wallets:** For any transfer ≥ AUD $10,000 to or from a self-hosted wallet where the controller's identity has not been verified, CoinPort must submit a report to AUSTRAC within 10 business days.

(b) **Reporting Mechanism:** Until AUSTRAC's new IVTS/Self-Hosted reporting forms are technically released, these transactions will be reported via the existing IFTI-E/DRA framework (or TTR if cash-linked).

(c) **Future Compliance:** Upon the formal commencement of the dedicated Self-Hosted Wallet Reporting obligation (as set by Ministerial rules), CoinPort will transition to the specific report type and format mandated by AUSTRAC.

(d) **Enhanced Due Diligence Requirements for ≥ AUD $10,000:**
- Customer must demonstrate wallet ownership (signature verification, test transaction, or declaration)
- Document source of funds for large unhosted transfers
- Senior management review may be required for very large amounts

**Below AUD $10,000:**
- Collect information for internal records (Duty 1)
- Standard AMLBot screening
- NO separate AUSTRAC reporting obligation for the self-hosted nature (standard IVTS reporting still applies if international)

**At or Above AUD $10,000:**
- Collect information for internal records (Duty 1)
- Enhanced due diligence and wallet ownership verification
- AUSTRAC reporting with self-hosted wallet notation (Duty 2)
- Document risk assessment and approval decision

---

#### **Scenario 3: Self-Hosted Wallet to VASP (Private Wallet to Exchange) - INCOMING**

**Same principles as Scenario 2:**

**For ALL incoming deposits from self-hosted wallets:**
- AMLBot blockchain analytics screening of source wallet
- Verify available originator information from customer
- Request additional information from customer if needed
- Document source of funds

**For incoming deposits ≥ AUD $10,000 from self-hosted wallets:**
- Enhanced blockchain analytics screening
- Customer must explain source of cryptocurrency
- Senior management review if high-risk indicators present
- AUSTRAC reporting if international transfer (IVTS - Section 24)
- Process deposit only if risk acceptable

---

### 25.3 Travel Rule Exemptions

**The following are exempt from Travel Rule data exchange (but NOT from internal collection or AUSTRAC reporting duties):**

- Transfers between CoinPort customer accounts (internal transfers - same entity)
- Transfers to/from self-hosted wallets (no counterparty VASP to exchange data with)
  - **Note:** Self-hosted transfers still require internal data collection (all amounts) and AUSTRAC reporting (≥$10k)

**NO exemption exists for VASP-to-VASP transfers based on amount.** All VASP-to-VASP transfers require full Travel Rule compliance regardless of value.

### 25.4 Travel Rule Technology Implementation

**Solution Providers:** 
- Primary: Sumsub (integrated KYC and Travel Rule solution)
- Secondary: Notabene (Travel Rule network connectivity)

**Technical Requirements:**
- VASP identification and verification via Travel Rule protocol
- Secure encrypted message exchange (TRP, TRUST, or equivalent protocol)
- Real-time information validation
- Screening against sanctions lists pre-transmission
- Audit trail of all Travel Rule messages
- Integration with blockchain analytics
- VASP directory access for counterparty verification
- Support for "first-share" protocols between VASPs

**VASP Counterparty Due Diligence (Mandatory Requirement):**

**CRITICAL:** Before transmitting Travel Rule information to another VASP, CoinPort must conduct counterparty due diligence to determine on reasonable grounds:

**Verification Requirements:**
1. **Confirm the counterparty is a legitimate VASP:**
   - Check VASP registration status with relevant regulator (AUSTRAC, FinCEN, FCA, etc.)
   - Verify the counterparty appears on recognized VASP directories (Notabene Network, TRISA Directory, etc.)
   - Confirm the counterparty has an AML/CTF program meeting regulatory standards

2. **Assess the counterparty's compliance capability:**
   - Can the counterparty securely receive and safeguard PII (personally identifiable information)?
   - Does the counterparty have capability to comply with Travel Rule obligations?
   - Is the counterparty's AML/CTF program robust enough to protect transmitted data?

3. **Sanctions screening of counterparty:**
   - Screen counterparty VASP against sanctions lists
   - Verify counterparty is not operating illegally or without proper registration
   - Check for adverse media or regulatory actions against counterparty

**Due Diligence Sources:**
- VASP registries (AUSTRAC public VASP Register, FinCEN MSB Registry, etc.)
- VASP directory services (Notabene, TRISA, TRP directories)
- Blockchain analytics provider VASP databases
- Public regulatory announcements and enforcement actions
- Industry reputation databases

**If Counterparty Due Diligence Fails:**
- CoinPort must NOT proceed with the transfer if:
  - Counterparty cannot be verified as a legitimate VASP
  - Counterparty appears on sanctions lists
  - Counterparty operating illegally or without registration
  - Counterparty cannot demonstrate adequate data protection capabilities
- Transaction must be declined and customer notified (without tipping off about specific concerns)
- Document decision rationale and inform senior management
- Consider filing SMR if suspicious circumstances identified

**Ongoing Monitoring:**
- Maintain list of approved counterparty VASPs
- Regular review (quarterly minimum) of counterparty compliance status
- Monitor for regulatory actions or adverse media regarding counterparties
- Remove counterparties from approved list if concerns identified

## 29. REQUEST TO OBTAIN INFORMATION FROM A CUSTOMER

29.1 Where CoinPort has provided or is providing a designated service to a customer and the AML/CTF CO believes, on reasonable grounds, that a customer has information that may assist CoinPort in the identification, management and mitigation of ML or TF risk, the AML/CTF CO may request the customer to provide such information. The request must be provided in writing and notify the customer that if the request is not complied with, then CoinPort may:
- (a) refuse to continue to provide a designated service;
- (b) refuse to commence to provide a designated service; or
- (c) restrict or limit the provision of the designated service.

29.2 If the customer does not comply with the request within a reasonable time then the AML/CTF CO may determine that, until the information is provided, CoinPort will take any of the actions in section 29.1(a) – (c).

29.3 In these circumstances, the AML/CTF CO will determine whether the matter should be reported to AUSTRAC as a suspicious matter (refer to section 22).

## 30. ONGOING CUSTOMER DUE DILIGENCE

30.1 CoinPort, as a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP), will monitor its customers for the purpose of identifying, mitigating and managing the ML/TF risk that the provision of a designated service may involve.

30.2 CoinPort will comply with the ongoing customer due diligence procedures outlined below.

### Types of Customers

**Customers CoinPort provides services to:**
- (a) Individuals (including sole traders)
- (b) Companies (Australian domestic and foreign registered)
- (c) Trusts (regulated and unregulated)
- (d) Trustees and beneficiaries
- (e) Partnerships
- (f) Self-Managed Super Funds (SMSFs)
- (g) Institutional clients (superannuation funds, corporate treasury)
- (h) Associations (if applicable)
- (i) Registered cooperatives (if applicable)

**Customers CoinPort will generally NOT provide services to:**
- (a) Government bodies (unless specific risk assessment conducted)
- (b) Entities in sanctioned jurisdictions
- (c) Unlicensed money services businesses
- (d) Entities that cannot provide adequate KYC documentation

**Review of Customer Types**: The AML/CTF CO is responsible for reviewing and updating the customer types that CoinPort provides services to on an ongoing basis.

### Monitoring Systems

CoinPort will monitor customers by implementing systems to:
- (a) collect further KYC Information for ongoing customer due diligence;
- (b) update and verify KYC Information;
- (c) monitor the transactions of customers; and
- (d) conduct enhanced customer due diligence in respect of high risk customers and customers about whom a suspicion has been formed.

### Grouping of Customers

As part of implementing systems for ongoing customer due diligence, CoinPort will group customers according to their level of risk, assessed as part of the risk assessment procedures. The risk grouping will determine:
- (a) what further KYC Information needs to be collected;
- (b) what level of transaction monitoring needs to be conducted; and
- (c) whether enhanced customer due diligence program needs to be applied.

The AML/CTF CO is responsible for grouping of customers. The AML/CTF CO will review the grouping of customers on a monthly basis, and the Board will conduct spot check on the grouping of customers on a half-yearly basis.

### Additional KYC Information

**Risk Assessment for New Activities and Technologies**: In undertaking risk assessment for new activities and technologies, the AML/CTF CO will determine whether any additional KYC Information or Beneficial Owner information should be collected from relevant customers either before any designated services are provided or during the course of CoinPort's relationship with the customer.

**Assessment on Level of ML/TF Risk**:

Based on the assessed level of ML/TF risk involved in provision of designated services, CoinPort has determined that:
- (i) Low Risk Customers - no additional KYC Information needs to be collected;
- (ii) Medium Risk Customers - the AML/CTF CO will determine what additional KYC Information or Beneficial Owner information will be collected;
- (iii) High Risk Customers - the AML/CTF CO will determine what additional KYC Information or Beneficial Owner information will be collected.

**New Customers**: In respect of a new customer, additional KYC Information will be collected at the same time as and in the same manner as KYC Information is required to be collected. Failure to provide additional KYC Information will be treated in the same way as failure to provide any other KYC Information.

**Existing Customers**: In respect of an existing customer or Beneficial Owner, CoinPort will update and re-verify KYC Information by requesting additional KYC Information where the AML/CTF CO considers the KYC Information is no longer up-to-date, incomplete or unreliable. CoinPort may also request additional KYC information where the scope of services provided to an existing customer changes.

**When to Update and Re-verify KYC Information**:

CoinPort will update and re-verify KYC Information in respect of a customer where:
- (a) the customer engages in a significant transaction or series of transactions, where a significant transaction occurs if a transaction or series of transactions conducted within any calendar month exceeds Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) of digital currency or physical currency in value; or
- (b) a significant change occurs:
  - (i) in the way the customer conducts transactions;
  - (ii) in the nature of the customer's business or business relationship;
  - (iii) in the customer's control structure;
  - (iv) in the customer's beneficial ownership; or
  - (v) in the number of transactions carried out by a customer increases by 100% within a five (5) calendar day period.

Where one of the above circumstances arises and the applicable customer identification procedure has not previously been carried out (i.e. the customer is a pre-commencement customer), CoinPort will carry out the applicable customer identification procedure and collect the relevant additional KYC Information.

Where a change in customer information relates to name, residential address, company registration number, trustee, name of trust, or identity of partner, CoinPort will seek to verify the updated KYC Information using reliable and independent documentation.

### Transaction Monitoring Program

**Responsible Persons**: The Director and the AML/CTF CO have overall responsibility and oversight of CoinPort's transaction-monitoring program. CoinPort conducts transaction monitoring on a monthly basis.

**Identification of Risk Factors**: The AML/CTF CO must identify ML/TF risk factors relevant to customers of particular services and products. Such risk factors include:
- (a) value of the transaction exceeds Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) of digital currency or physical currency in value;
- (b) volume of transactions conducted by a customer within a five (5) calendar day period has increased by more than one hundred per cent (100%);
- (c) transaction involves foreign countries, customers or third parties against whom sanctions have been imposed or have been included on lists maintained by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade;
- (d) transaction involves a customer or third party who is a PEP;
- (e) AMLBot blockchain analytics indicate links to high-risk addresses, sanctioned wallets, blacklisted exchanges, or mixing services;
- (f) Travel Rule information incomplete or suspicious for any VASP-to-VASP transfer (from March 2026);
- (g) High-value transfers to/from self-hosted wallets (≥ AUD $10,000);
- (h) Non-compliance with Travel Rule requirements by counterparty VASPs;
- (i) AMLBot flags wallet addresses associated with darknet markets, ransomware, or theft;
- (j) Deposits from exchanges or wallets flagged as high-risk by AMLBot.

**Steps After Risk Factors Identified**:
- (a) An employee must immediately inform the AML/CTF CO when any ML or TF risk factor(s) are identified;
- (b) The AML/CTF CO will then liaise with the Board in relation to any further action;
- (c) Where an employee identifies a customer or third party of a kind specified above, the AML/CTF CO will take appropriate action to determine, with a reasonable degree of certainty, whether the customer or third party is that person.

**Further Actions**: If it is determined, as a result of transaction monitoring, that:
- (a) a customer should be placed in a higher risk grouping, CoinPort will collect additional KYC Information if required;
- (b) KYC Information needs to be updated or verified, CoinPort will update or verify the required information;
- (c) a customer is a high-risk customer, CoinPort will apply the enhanced customer due diligence program; or
- (d) a suspicious matter report needs to be lodged, CoinPort will follow the procedure outlined in Section 22.

**Training on Identification of Risk Factors**: In addition to the Risk Awareness Training, the AML/CTF CO will ensure that all employees who have direct contact with customers or their representatives receive regular training in the identification of ML/TF risk factors.

**Review and Update**: The AML/CTF CO, in consultation with the Board, must regularly assess CoinPort's transaction monitoring program and take steps to have this modified appropriately when required.

### Enhanced Customer Due Diligence Program

**Responsible Persons**: The AML/CTF CO has overall responsibility and oversight of CoinPort's enhanced customer due diligence program.

**Factors for Conducting Enhanced Customer Due Diligence**:

The ML/TF risk associated with a particular designated service, customer, delivery method or jurisdiction is high, including but not limited to when:
- (a) the customer:
  - (i) is engaged in business which involves a significant number of cash transactions or amounts of cash; or
  - (ii) uses a complex business ownership structure for no apparent commercial reason; or
  - (iii) is based in, or conducts business through or in, a high-risk jurisdiction; or
  - (iv) cannot provide information to verify the source of funds; or
  - (v) requests an undue level of secrecy in relation to a designated service; or
  - (vi) is a PEP; or
- (b) a designated service is being provided to a customer who is or who has a Beneficial Owner who is, a foreign politically exposed person; or
- (c) a suspicion has arisen for the purposes of section 41 of the AML/CTF Act (refer to Section 22); or
- (d) CoinPort is entering into or proposing to enter into a transaction and a party to the transaction is physically present, or is a company incorporated in, a prescribed foreign country; or
- (e) blockchain analytics indicate high-risk transaction patterns or wallet associations; or
- (f) Travel Rule information is incomplete, inconsistent, or indicates unusual cross-border transaction patterns (from March 2026); or
- (g) Large transfers to/from self-hosted wallets (≥ AUD $10,000) with insufficient explanation.

**Steps After Factors Identified**:

Where one or more of the factors above arises, the AML/CTF CO will arrange for one or more of the following due diligence procedures:
- (a) seek further information from the customer or from third party sources to:
  - (i) clarify or update the customer's KYC Information or Beneficial Owner information;
  - (ii) obtain any further KYC Information or Beneficial Owner information including taking reasonable measures to identify:
    - A. the source of the customer's and each Beneficial Owner's wealth; and
    - B. the source of the customer's and each Beneficial Owner's funds; and
  - (iii) clarify the nature of the customer's ongoing business with CoinPort.
- (b) conduct more detailed analysis in respect of the customer's KYC Information and Beneficial Owner information taking reasonable measures to identify the source of wealth and funds;
- (c) verify or re-verify KYC Information or Beneficial Owner information;
- (d) conduct more detailed analysis and monitoring in respect of the customer's activities and transactions – both past and future, including:
  - (i) the purpose, reasons for, or nature of specific transactions;
  - (ii) the expected nature and level of transaction behaviour, including future transactions;
- (e) consider whether a Suspicious Matter Report ought to be lodged;
- (f) seek senior manager approval for:
  - (i) continuing a business relationship with a customer; and
  - (ii) whether a designated service should continue to be provided; and
- (g) consider whether a transaction or particular transactions should be processed.

- (b) when CoinPort's employee is responsible for the customer (or another CoinPort employee on their behalf), unless the AML/CTF CO authorises that these procedures can be conducted by an external party.

32.2 The same KYC procedures will be applied across all CoinPort's customers to ensure that additional procedures do not need to be carried out where a customer uses more than one of CoinPort's designated services.

32.3 Where CoinPort outsources the customer identification and verification procedures to a responsible third party, the AML/CTF CO maintains overall responsibility for KYC obligations.

### KYC Considerations

32.4 Once information relating to a customer has been collected and verified, CoinPort will re-assess the money laundering or terrorism financing risk posed by the customer.

32.5 In re-assessing the AML/CTF risk for each customer, CoinPort may consider, where appropriate and among other factors, whether:
- (a) the customer is unwilling to produce evidence of identification or produces unsatisfactory evidence;
- (b) the customer wishes to deal only in large amounts of cash and not in traceable bank transfers;
- (c) the customer or group of customers makes frequent transactions to the same individual or group;
- (d) the customer is willing to pay very high charges to complete a transaction;
- (e) the customer's normal remitting behaviour changes and they are unwilling to explain the reason or the source of the increase funds;
- (f) the customer is involved in a complex business ownership structure with no legitimate commercial rationale;
- (g) the non-individual customer has a complex business structure with little commercial justification, which obscures the identity of ultimate beneficiaries;
- (h) the customer is in a position which may expose CoinPort to the possibility of corruption;
- (i) the customer is based in, or conducting business through or in, a high-risk jurisdiction;
- (j) the customer is engaged in business which involves significant amounts of cash;
- (k) there is no clear commercial rationale for the customer seeking a designated service;
- (l) the customer is a PEP;
- (m) an undue level of secrecy is requested regarding a designated service;
- (n) the source of funds is difficult to verify;
- (o) the Beneficial Owners of a non-individual customer are difficult to identify and/or verify;
- (p) the Beneficial Owners of the non-individual customer are a resident in a high-risk jurisdiction;
- (q) there is a one-off transaction in comparison with an ongoing business relationship or series of transactions;
- (r) a designated service can be used for money laundering or terrorism financing;
- (s) the customer makes or accepts payments to or from accounts which have not been identified by CoinPort;
- (t) the customer makes or accepts payments to or from offshore accounts;
- (u) the customer has access to offshore funds;
- (v) the customer when migrating from one designated service to another carries a different type and level of AML/CTF risk;
- (w) the customer has income which is not employment-based or from a regular known source;
- (x) the customer is new, rather than having a long-term and active business relationship with CoinPort;
- (y) the customer's business is primarily of a money remittance service nature;
- (z) the customer's business is registered in a foreign jurisdiction with no local operations or domicile;
- (aa) the customer's business is an unregistered charity, foundation or cultural association;

### Fraud Detection and Prevention

32.6 A major risk is that criminal fraudsters may attempt to use the exchange platform to disperse, launder and transfer funds from local members to places outside jurisdiction as blockchain transfers.

32.7 Exchange members vulnerable to fraud need to be identified and additional steps taken to protect them against fraud.

32.8 CoinPort has identified that certain categories of people are more susceptible to fraud. These people need to be identified and manual intervention performed to validate them as genuine cryptocurrency traders.

32.9 At the second step of the client on-boarding process, members are required to input their date of birth.
- (i) If the new member is more than 55 years of age a member of the support staff must phone and speak with them.
- (ii) Questions should be asked about their interest and knowledge of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.
- (iii) Details of these conversations must be logged in detail in the Fresh Desk support database.
- (iv) If the new member is identified as a potential fraud victim they should be advised of concerns.
- (v) Likely fraud victims must have their User status set to "banned" to prevent access to the exchange platform.

### Risk Exposure Categories

32.10 CoinPort has made the following assessment in relation to risk categories of its customers:

| Risk Exposure | Information to be collected | Certified Documents Required? |

If a counterparty VASP repeatedly fails to respond to Travel Rule messages:
1. Document 3+ failed attempts over 24-hour period
2. Escalate to MEDIUM risk (if not already HIGH/CRITICAL)
3. Notify customer of delay (without disclosing VASP compliance issues)
