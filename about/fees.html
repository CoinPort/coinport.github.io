<h1>CoinPort Fees</h1>
<p>There are no commissions or fees for crypto orders or trades on the CoinPort exchange platform.</p>
<p>We try to make the CoinPort as simple and transparent as possible. The price quoted is the price dealt.</p>
<p>CoinPort does not charge fees for AUD fiat currency Deposits or Withdraws via the New Payment Processing (NPP) network.</p>
<p>Blockchain transaction fees for crypto Deposits and Withdraws may be deducted where these blockchain fees are non-trivial. For example, in the past transactions on the Ethereum blockchain have exceeded $30.</p>
