Given CoinPort is a crypto exchange, your RMs will need a robust foundation in **traditional finance regulation** combined with **deep crypto-specific knowledge**. Here is a structured training plan with specific courses and materials.

### **Core Philosophy for Your Training Plan:**
1.  **Dual Competence:** Build expertise in both (a) general AFSL compliance/obligations and (b) the specific nature and risks of crypto assets.
2.  **Evidence for ASIC:** Use formal courses and certifications to build an auditable trail of knowledge acquisition.
3.  **Internal & External:** Combine external accredited courses with rigorous internal training on your own operations.

These address the core AFSL requirements for all financial services.

**1. Australian Financial Regulation & AFSL Core Obligations:**
*   **Course Provider:** **Australian Financial Markets Association (AFMA)** and **Finance & Treasury Association (FTA)**.
*   **Recommended Course:** **"AFS Licensing and Compliance"** or **"Core Compliance for Financial Services."**
*   **Content:** Detailed coverage of the *Corporations Act 2001*, AFSL general obligations, breach reporting, design and distribution obligations (DDO), internal dispute resolution, and ASIC regulatory guides (especially **RG 105** on licensing and **RG 104** on RGMs).

**2. Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing (AML/CTF):**
*   **Course Provider:** **Austrac** (Regulator) and **Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists (ACAMS).**

**4. Financial Markets and Derivatives (if offering futures, options, leveraged tokens):**
*   **Course Provider:** **AFMA** and **Securities & Derivatives Industry Association (SDIA).**
*   **Recommended Course:** **"Derivatives Fundamentals"** or **"Financial Markets Regulation."**

**3. Digital Asset Custody (Critical for an Exchange):**
*   **Materials:** This is niche. Combine:
    *   **Industry Reports:** From **Fidelity Digital Assets, Coinbase Institutional,** or **BitGo** on custody frameworks.

    *   **AML/CTF Program:** Customer onboarding (CDD), ongoing monitoring, sanctions screening, transaction monitoring rules.

### **Final Critical Advice:**
*   **Engage a Compliance Consultant Early:** A lawyer or consultant who has **successfully guided crypto firms through AFSL applications** is invaluable. They can tailor this training plan, recommend the most relevant courses, and provide formal letters of advice that ASIC respects.
*   **Map to RG 105:** Structure your staff's training around the specific knowledge areas in **RG 105.73-105.76** for each financial service you list on your license (e.g., "dealing in crypto assets," "providing custody," "making a market").
*   **Start Now:** 2026 is an appropriate timeline, but this process takes significant time. Starting now demonstrates to ASIC a serious, long-term commitment to compliance.
