# CoinPort Exchange 360-Degree Security

We safeguard user funds by securing our platform with strict protocols and industry-leading technical measures. From real-time monitoring and a 360-degree risk management system to advanced data privacy tools and end user security education, we continually find innovative ways to protect the users we serve.

## Platform Security

### Secure Storage

The vast majority of user funds and assets are safely stored in offline, cold wallet storage facilities.

### Real Time Monitoring

Our risk management system analyzes every withdrawal attempt, password reset, two-factor authentication reset and email address change. Unusual activity triggers suspended withdrawals for a minimum of 24-48 hours.

### Organizational Security

Our wallet and personnel infrastructure features advanced security measures, including multisignature and threshold signature schemes (TSS), ensure the safety and integrity of our users’ funds.

### Advanced Data Encryption

We protect user data and personal information, including Know-Your-Customer (KYC) information, by encrypting data in storage. Meanwhile, data in transit is secured via end-to-end encryption, ensuring only users have access to their personal information.

## User-Level Security

### Safe Sign In

CoinPort supports strict sign-in protocols using two-factor authentication, including hardware, app-based, SMS and email methods.

### Access Control

Advanced access control provides users with opt-in security features such as IP and wallet address whitelisting, API access control and device management.

### Security Notifications

Receive emails, notifications and security alerts in the event that suspicious activity is detected. Users can secure their account by restricting access to unwanted third parties.
