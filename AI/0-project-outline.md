### Project Outline for Implementing a Deep Reinforcement Learning AI Model for Market-Making in a Cryptocurrency Exchange Using Microsoft Azure

#### Overview

This project aims to develop and implement a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) AI model for market-making strategies in a cryptocurrency exchange. The model will be hosted and trained on Microsoft Azure's cloud platform, leveraging its AI and machine learning capabilities.

#### Objectives

1. **Develop a DRL model** to optimize bid-ask spreads, improve liquidity, and maximize profits in a cryptocurrency exchange environment.
2. **Ensure robustness and scalability** of the model to handle high-frequency trading and real-time decision-making.
3. **Integrate with a cryptocurrency exchange** for real-time data feeding and order execution.
4. **Comply with regulatory standards** and ensure ethical use of AI in financial trading.
