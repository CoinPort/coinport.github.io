### 1. GENERAL INFORMATION

This Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (AML/CTF) Policy (“Policy") of Coin Harbour Pty Ltd (the “Company”) was prepared in accordance with Australia's _Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006_ (AML/CTF Act), the _Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Rules Instrument in Force 2017_ (AUSTRAC Rules), and other applicable AML/CTF legislation. The Company, operating the digital currency exchange and website known as CoinPort, is a reporting entity regulated by the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC).

The purpose of this Policy is to provide Customers with a high-level overview of CoinPort's AML/CTF compliance regime. This Policy is not an exhaustive list of all policies, procedures, and controls implemented by the Company for the prevention of money laundering, financing of terrorism, and other illicit activities.

All definitions are used within the meaning of the Australian AML/CTF Act.

### 2. OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY

**Responsibilities of the Company:**

-   **Enrolment and Registration:** Maintaining enrolment and registration with AUSTRAC as a digital currency exchange provider.

-   **Record Keeping:** Retaining all necessary records of transactions, customer identification, and AML/CTF program documentation for a minimum of seven years.

### 3. CUSTOMER DUE DILIGENCE

Customer Due Diligence (CDD) is a cornerstone of CoinPort's risk management framework. CoinPort will collect and verify information upon account opening and on an ongoing basis to identify our Customers and understand their expected financial activities.

Depending on the Customer’s risk profile, as determined by our risk-based assessment, CoinPort applies different levels of CDD.

#### 3.1. Application of Standard Due Diligence Measures

Standard due diligence, or KYC, is applied to all Customers.

In the course of applying standard due diligence, a Customer who is a **natural person** is obliged to provide at least the following identification information:

-   Full name
-   Date of birth
-   Residential address
-   Contact email and phone number
-   A government-issued photographic identification document (e.g., Passport, Australian Driver's Licence).
-   A secondary document for address verification (e.g., utility bill, bank statement).
-   A liveness check may be required to verify the customer's presence.

In the course of applying standard due diligence, a Customer that is a **legal entity** is obliged to provide information and documents including, but not limited to:

-   Full legal name, as registered with the relevant authority (e.g., ASIC).
-   Australian Business Number (ABN) or Australian Company Number (ACN).
-   Registered office and principal place of business.
-   Constitutional documents (e.g., Articles of Association).
-   Identification information for all directors, beneficial owners (who own or control 25% or more of the entity), and any appointed representatives.
-   Information on the nature of the business and its ownership/control structure.

The Company verifies the correctness of the Customer’s data using reliable and independent sources, including electronic verification services and official government registers.

To prevent illegal transactions, CoinPort requires that the sender of a payment and the account holder are the same person. Payments to or from third parties are strictly prohibited.

#### 3.2. Application of Enhanced Due Diligence Measures

In addition to standard measures, CoinPort applies Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) to manage and mitigate risks that are assessed as being higher than usual.

The Company will always apply EDD measures in situations including, but not limited to:

-   When a Customer is identified as a Politically Exposed Person (PEP), a family member of a PEP, or a close associate of a PEP.
-   When a Customer is from, or a transaction involves, a country or jurisdiction identified as high-risk by sources such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) or AUSTRAC.
-   For complex, unusually large transactions or patterns of transactions that have no apparent economic or visible lawful purpose.
-   Where there are doubts about the veracity or adequacy of previously obtained customer identification data.

EDD may include one or more of the following measures, proportionate to the identified risk:

-   Obtaining additional identification documents or information from credible sources.
-   Gathering additional information on the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship.
-   Gathering detailed information and evidence to establish the source of funds and source of wealth of the Customer.
-   Increasing the degree and frequency of monitoring of the business relationship and transactions.

#### 3.3. Establishing the Source of Funds

Understanding the origin of the funds used in transactions is a critical part of our risk assessment. The Company may request information and evidence to establish the source of funds or wealth in certain situations, including where transactions exceed internal thresholds, do not align with a Customer's known profile, or are otherwise deemed high-risk.

### 4. POLITICALLY EXPOSED PERSONS (PEPs) IDENTIFICATION

CoinPort has implemented procedures to manage the increased risks associated with Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs). The Company takes reasonable measures to determine whether a Customer or a beneficial owner is a PEP.

Under the Australian AML/CTF Act, a PEP is an individual who holds a prominent public position or function in a government body or an international organisation, either in Australia or overseas. The definition also includes their immediate family members and close associates.

When a Customer is identified as a PEP, they are automatically subject to Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) measures and ongoing, intensified monitoring of the business relationship.

### 5. NOT ACCEPTABLE CUSTOMERS

The following list predetermines the type of Customers who are not acceptable for establishing a business relationship with CoinPort:

-   Customers who fail or refuse to submit the requested data and information for identity verification.
-   Shell Banks (banks with no physical presence or affiliation with a regulated financial group).
-   Customers from jurisdictions which are subject to international sanctions or are deemed high-risk according to CoinPort's internal policies.
-   Any other customer that the Company considers to pose an unacceptable risk to its business in regard to money laundering and terrorist financing.

CoinPort will not accept as Customers, persons or entities from the following countries and territories: Afghanistan, Algeria, Belarus, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Cambodia, Central African Republic, China, Cuba, Crimea, Côte d'Ivoire, Congo, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Ethiopia, Dominican Republic, Donetsk, Eritrea, Ghana, Guatemala, Guyana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Honduras, Iran, Iraq, Jamaica, Jordan, Kenya, Kosovo, Laos, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Luhansk, Mali, Morocco, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nagorno-Karabakh, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Northern Cyprus, Pakistan, Philippines, Russia, Senegal, Somalia, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Syria, Trinidad and Tobago, Transnistria, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Uganda, Vanuatu, Venezuela, Yemen, Zimbabwe.
