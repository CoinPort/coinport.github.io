# CoinPort Exchange Security

Protecting user funds and data is a core responsibility at CoinPort. We apply layered security controls across our platform, combining technical safeguards, monitoring systems, and user-level protections to reduce risk and respond quickly to suspicious activity.

## Platform security

### Secure storage

The majority of digital assets are stored in offline, cold-wallet environments designed to reduce exposure to online threats.

### Real-time monitoring

Our risk management systems monitor account activity such as withdrawals, password changes, two-factor authentication resets, and email updates. Suspicious or unusual activity may trigger additional review or temporary withdrawal restrictions.

### Organisational security

CoinPort employs industry-standard wallet security practices, including multisignature and threshold signature schemes (TSS), to help safeguard digital assets and reduce single points of failure.

### Data protection

User data, including identity verification information, is encrypted at rest. Data transmitted between users and our systems is protected using secure transport encryption.

## User-level security

### Secure sign-in

CoinPort supports multi-factor authentication for account access, including app-based authenticators and other supported methods.

### Access controls

Users can enable optional security features such as IP restrictions, withdrawal address whitelisting, API permission controls, and device management.

### Security alerts

Account notifications and alerts are provided for key security-related events, allowing users to respond quickly to unexpected activity.

## Compliance and responsibility

CoinPort is committed to meeting applicable regulatory and compliance obligations. We continually review and improve our security controls to support the safe operation of the platform and protect our users.
