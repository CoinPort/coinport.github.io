*"G’day, I’m Leonie Green from CoinPort! Jumping into crypto can feel overwhelming—so many coins, so much hype! But don’t worry. Today, I’ll share 5 simple research tips to help you make smarter, safer crypto decisions. Let’s dive in!"*  

---  

### **🔍 Tip #1: Start with the Basics – Whitepapers & Websites**  
**[Scene: A "Bitcoin Whitepaper" document opens, highlighting key sections.]**  

**Leonie:**  
*"Every legit project has a **whitepaper** (like a crypto blueprint) and a **website**. Ask yourself:  
- Does their whitepaper explain the tech clearly?  
- Is their team transparent with real LinkedIn profiles?  
- Does their roadmap look realistic?**  

*If it’s all buzzwords and no substance? Red flag!*"*  

---  

### **🔍 Tip #2: Check the Community & Social Proof**  
**[Scene: Twitter, Discord, and Telegram icons light up with activity.]**  

**Leonie:**  
*"A strong community = a healthier project. Peek at their **Twitter, Discord, or Reddit**:  
- Are devs active and answering questions?  
- Is the community respectful or full of moon-shot spam?  
- Avoid ‘echo chambers’ where no one asks tough questions!*"*  

---  

### **🔍 Tip #3: Use Trusted Data Tools**  
**[Scene: CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, and Etherscan logos appear with live data charts.]**  

**Leonie:**  
*"Don’t trust random influencers! Verify stats yourself:  
- **CoinGecko/CoinMarketCap**: Check market cap, volume, and supply.  
- **Etherscan**: For Ethereum tokens, verify contracts (avoid ‘honeypot’ scams!).  
- **GitHub**: Active devs? Regular code updates? Good sign!*"*  

---  

### **🔍 Tip #4: Learn from Multiple Sources**  
**[Scene: A "Crypto News" split-screen: reputable sites (CoinDesk) vs. clickbait ("THIS COIN WILL 100X!").]**  

**Leonie:**  
*"Balance your research:  
✅ **Reputable news**: CoinDesk, Decrypt, Bankless.  
⚠️ **Avoid**: YouTube ‘pump’ channels or anonymous ‘insider tips’.  
*Pro tip: If someone says ‘guaranteed profits’, run!*"*  

---  

### **🔍 Tip #5: Start Small & Track Your Trades**  
**[Scene: A wallet with tiny crypto purchases and a notepad labeled "Lessons Learned".]**  

**Leonie:**  
*"Never go ‘all in’ on hype! Start with small amounts to:  
- Test how the tech works (e.g., send $10 first!).  
- Learn your emotional triggers (FOMO is real!).  
- Keep a journal—what worked? What failed?*"*

### **📚 Leonie’s Research Checklist**
