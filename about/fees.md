CoinPort Fees      

# CoinPort Fees

There are no commissions or fees for crypto orders or trades on the CoinPort exchange platform.

We try to make the CoinPort as simple and transparent as possible. The price quoted is the price dealt.

CoinPort does not charge fees for AUD fiat currency Deposits or Withdraws via the New Payment Processing (NPP) network.

Blockchain transaction fees for crypto Deposits and Withdraws may be deducted where these blockchain fees are non-trivial. For example, in the past transactions on the Ethereum blockchain have exceeded $30.
