  <h2>What is Money Laundering?</h2>
  <p>Money laundering is the process in which the proceeds of crime are transformed into legitimate money or other
    assets. However, in a number of legal and regulatory systems the term money laundering has become conflated with
    other forms of financial crime, and sometimes used more generally to include misuse of the financial system
    (involving things such as securities, digital currencies, credit cards, and traditional currency), including
    terrorism financing, tax evasion and evading of international sanctions.</p>

  <h2>What is Terrorism Financing?</h2>
  <p>Simply put it is the use of funds, concealing the original source, for use in acts of terrorism.</p>

  <h2>Who is AUSTRAC?</h2>
  <p>AUSTRAC is an Australian Government Financial Intelligence Agency that was set up to monitor financial
    transactions. It specifically looks to identify money laundering, tax evasion, welfare fraud, terrorism and
    organised crime.</p>
