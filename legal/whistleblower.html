    <h1>CoinPort Whistleblower Policy</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>At Coin Habour Pty Ltd (“the Company”) we are guided by our company values. These values are the foundation of
      how we conduct ourselves and interact with each other, our clients, members, suppliers, shareholders and other
      stakeholders. The Company is committed to ensuring corporate compliance and promoting ethical corporate culture by
      observing the highest standards of fair dealing, honesty and integrity in our business activities.</p>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>The policy has been put in place to ensure any concerns raised regarding any misconduct or improper state of
      aﬀairs or circumstances in relation to the Company’s business are dealt with eﬀectively, securely, appropriately,
      and in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act).</p>
    <p>The Company encourages the reporting of any instances of suspected unethical, illegal, corrupt, fraudulent or
      undesirable conduct involving the Company’s business and provides protections and measures to individuals who make
      a disclosure in relation to such conduct without fear of victimisation or reprisal.</p>
    <p>This policy will be provided to all employees and oﬃcers of the Company upon commencement of their employment or
      engagement.</p>

    <h2>Scope</h2>
    <p>This policy applies to any person who is, or has been, any of the following with respect to the Company:
      Employee;</p>

    <p>Coin Port uses a variety to prevent access from sanctioned countries.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Oﬃcer;</li>
      <li>Director;</li>
      <li>Contractor (including sub-contractors and employees of contractors); Supplier (including employees of
        suppliers);</li>
      <li>Consultant; Auditor; Associate; and</li>
      <li>Relative, dependant, spouse, or dependant of a spouse of any of the above.</li>
      <li>This policy is intended to apply to the above persons in all countries in which the Company operates a
        business.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reportable Conduct</h2>
    <p>You may make a report or disclosure under this policy if you have reasonable grounds to believe that a Company
      director, oﬃcer, employee, contractor, supplier, consultant or other person who has business dealings with the
      Company has engaged in conduct (Reportable Conduct) which is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Dishonest, fraudulent or corrupt;</li>
      <li>Illegal (such as theft, dealing in or use of illicit drugs, violence or threatened violence and criminal
        damage to property);</li>
      <li>Unethical including any breach of the Company’s policies such as the Code of Conduct; Oppressive or grossly
        negligent;</li>
      <li>Potentially damaging to the Company, its employees or a third party; Misconduct or an improper state of
        aﬀairs;</li>
      <li>A danger, or represents a danger to the public or ﬁnancial system; Harassment, discrimination, victimisation
        or bullying.</li>
      <li>Any disclosures that do not fall within the deﬁnition of Reportable Conduct, will not qualify for protection
        under the Act. It will be at the</li>
      <li>Company’s discretion whether it considers there is a reasonable suspicion that the Reportable Conduct is
        occurring and/or whether the conduct constitutes “misconduct or improper state of aﬀairs” under the Act.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For the avoidance of doubt, Reportable Conduct does not include personal work-related grievances. A personal
      work-related grievance is a grievance about any matter in relation to a staﬀ member’s current or former
      employment, having implications (or tending to have implications) for that person personally and that do not have
      broader implications for the Company. Examples of personal work-related grievances are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An interpersonal conﬂict between the staﬀ member and another employee;</li>
      <li>A decision relating to the engagement, transfer or promotion of the staﬀ member; A decision relating to the
        terms and conditions of engagement of the staﬀ member;</li>
      <li>A decision to suspend or terminate the engagement of the staﬀ member, or otherwise to discipline the staﬀ
        member.</li>
      <li>Personal work-related grievances should be reported to your manager or in accordance with the Company’s
        Grievance Policy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Making A Disclosure</h2>
    <p>The Company relies on its employees maintaining a culture of honest and ethical behaviour. Accordingly, if you
      become aware of any Reportable Conduct, it is expected that you will make a disclosure under this policy.</p>
    <p>There are several ways in which you may report or disclose any issue or behaviour which you consider to be
      Reportable Conduct.</p>

    <h2>Internal Reporting</h2>
    <p>You may disclose any Reportable Conduct to the Whistleblower Protection Oﬃcers listed below:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Human Resources Manager</li>
      <li>Compliance Manager</li>
      <li>Chief Executive Oﬃcer</li>
      <li>The Company's external law firm</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can make a disclosure outside of business hours by contacting the above Whistleblower Protection Oﬃcers via
      email.</p>
    <p>You are also encouraged to contact the above Whistleblower Protection Oﬃcers to obtain any additional information
      you may require before making a disclosure or for any clariﬁcation regarding this policy.</p>

    <p>If you are unable to use any of the above reporting channels, a disclosure can be made to an “eligible recipient”
      within the Company. Eligible recipients include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Oﬃcers;</li>
      <li>Directors;</li>
      <li>Senior Managers;</li>
      <li>Auditor or member of an audit team conducting an audit of the Company;</li>
      <li>Actuary.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The Whistleblower Protection Oﬃcer or eligible recipient will safeguard your interests and will ensure the
      integrity of the reporting mechanism.</p>

    <h2>External Reporting</h2>
    <p>Where you do not feel comfortable making an internal report, or where you have made an internal report, but no
      action has been taken within a reasonable time, you may disclose any Reportable Conduct to the Company’s external
      auditor/external independent whistleblower service [Insert name] using any of the following methods:</p>

    [Email Address]
    [Phone Number]
    Calls will be received by [Person Name] during business hours between [Start Time] and [Closing Time] and can also
    be accessed after business hours by contacting [Person Name]. Your call will not be recorded and the person taking
    your call is not associated with the Company in any way.

    They are trained specialists dedicated to dealing with whistleblowers and their concerns.

    [Person Name] will prepare a report which details the concerns raised by you to a Whistleblower Protection Oﬃcer.
    Any information contained in the report will be kept conﬁdential, except as required by law or where disclosure is
    necessary to regulatory authorities, law enforcement agencies or professional advisors to the Company.

    <h2>Anonymity</h2>
    <p>When making a disclosure, you may do so anonymously. It may be diﬃcult for the Company to properly investigate
      the matters disclosed if a report is submitted anonymously and therefore the Company encourages you to share your
      identity when making a disclosure, however you are not required to do so.</p>
    <p>Where a disclosure has been made externally and you provide your contact details, those contact details will only
      be provided to a Whistleblower Protection Oﬃcer with your consent.</p>

    <h2>Reporting to Regulators</h2>
    <p>You may also make a disclosure to the [Insert relevant government body] in relation to a Reportable Conduct. You
      will be covered by the protections outlined in this policy if you have reported your concerns to [Insert relevant
      government body]</p>

    <h2>Reporting to a Legal Practitioner</h2>
    <p>You may choose to discuss your concerns with a legal practitioner for the purposes of obtaining legal advice or
      representation. You will be covered by the protections outlined in this policy if you have reported your concerns
      to a legal practitioner.</p>

    <h2>Public Interest and Emergency Disclosure</h2>
    <p>In certain situations, the conduct or wrongdoing may be of such gravity and urgency that disclosure to the media
      or a parliamentarian is necessary.</p>

    <p>A public interest and emergency disclosure can only be made to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A journalist, deﬁned to mean a person who is working in a professional capacity as a journalist for a
        newspaper, magazine, or radio or television broadcasting service; or</li>
      <li>A Member of the Parliament</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You may only make a public interest and emergency disclosure if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You have previously disclosed the information to [Insert relevant government body];</li>
      <li>At least 90 days has passed since the previous disclosure was made;</li>
      <li>You have reasonable grounds to believe that action is not being taken to address the matters which you have
        disclosed;</li>
      <li>You have reasonable grounds to believe that making a further disclosure to a journalist or member of
        parliament would be in the public interest;</li>
      <li>You have given written notiﬁcation, including suﬃcient information to identify the previous disclosure to the
        authority to which the previous disclosure was made that you intend on making a public interest disclosure; and
      </li>
      <li>The extent of information disclosed is no greater than is necessary to inform the recipient of the misconduct
        or improper state of aﬀairs.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You will be qualiﬁed for protection where you have made a public interest disclosure if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You have previously disclosed the information to ASIC;</li>
      <li>You have reasonable grounds to believe that the information concerns a substantial and imminent danger</li>
      <li>to the health or safety of one or more persons, or to the natural environment; and</li>
      <li>You have given written notiﬁcation, including suﬃcient information to identify the previous disclosure to the
        authority to which the previous disclosure was made that you intend on making a public interest disclosure; and
      </li>
      <li>No more information is disclosed than is reasonably necessary to inform the recipient of the substantial and
        imminent danger.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Investigation</h2>
    <p>The Company will investigate all matters reported under this policy as soon as practicable after the matter has
      been reported. The Whistleblower Protection Oﬃcer will investigate the matter and where necessary, appoint an
      external investigator to assist in conducting the investigation. All investigations will be conducted in a fair,
      independent and timely manner and all reasonable eﬀorts will be made to preserve conﬁdentiality during the
      investigation.</p>
    <p>If the report is not anonymous, the Whistleblower Protection Oﬃcer or external investigator will contact you, by
      your preferred method of communication to discuss the investigation process and any other matters that are
      relevant to the investigation.</p>
    <p>Where you have chosen to remain anonymous, your identity will not be disclosed to the investigator or to any
      other person and the Company will conduct the investigation based on the information provided to it.</p>
    <p>Where possible, the Whistleblower Protection Oﬃcer will provide you with feedback on the progress and expected
      timeframes of the investigation. The person against whom any allegations have been made will also be informed of
      the concerns and will be provided with an opportunity to respond (unless there are any restrictions or other
      reasonable bases for not doing so).</p>
    <p>To the extent permitted by law, the Whistleblower Protection Oﬃcer may inform you and/or a person against whom
      allegations have been made of the ﬁndings. The Company will document the ﬁndings in a report however any report
      will remain the property of the Company and will only be shared with you or any person against whom the
      allegations have been made if the Company deems it appropriate.</p>

    <h2>Protection Of Whistleblowers</h2>
    <p>The Company is committed to ensuring that any person who makes a disclosure is treated fairly and does not suﬀer
      detriment and that conﬁdentiality is preserved in respect of all matters raised under this policy.</p>

    <h2>Protection from Legal Action</h2>
    <p>You will not be subject to any civil, criminal or administrative legal action (including disciplinary action) for
      making a disclosure under this policy or participating in any investigation.</p>
    <p>Any information you provide will not be admissible in any criminal or civil proceedings other than for
      proceedings in respect of the falsity of the information.</p>

    <h2>Protection against Detrimental Conduct</h2>
    <p>The Company (or any person engaged by the Company) will not engage in ‘Detrimental Conduct’ against you if you
      have made a disclosure under this policy.</p>

    <p>Detrimental Conduct includes actual or threatened conduct such as the following (without limitation):</p>
    <ul>

    </ul>

    <p>The Company also strictly prohibits all forms of Detrimental Conduct against any person who is involved in an
      investigation of a matter disclosed under the policy in response to their involvement in that investigation.</p>
    <p>The Company will take all reasonable steps to protect you from Detrimental Conduct and will take necessary action
      where such conduct is identiﬁed. If appropriate, the Company may allow you to perform your duties from another
      location or reassign you to another role (at the same level) or make other modiﬁcations to your workplace or your
      duties to protect you from the risk of detriment.</p>
    <p>If you are subjected to Detrimental Conduct as a result of making a disclosure under this policy or participating
      in an investigation, you should inform a Whistleblower Protection Oﬃcer or eligible recipient in accordance with
      the reporting guidelines outlined above.</p>

    <p>You may also seek remedies including compensation, civil penalties or reinstatement if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You suﬀer loss, damage or injury because of a disclosure; and</li>
      <li>The Company failed to take reasonable precautions and exercise due diligence to prevent any Detrimental
        Conduct.</li>
      <li>Protection of Confidentiality</li>
      <li>All information received from you will be treated conﬁdentially and sensitively.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You will not be required to provide your name when making a disclosure. To make a disclosure on an anonymous
      basis, it is recommended that you use a pseudonym and contact the Whistleblowing Protection Oﬃcers in the manner
      outlined above.</p>
    <p>If you report on an anonymous basis, you will still qualify for the protections in this policy.</p>

    <p>If you make a disclosure under this policy, your identity (or any information which would likely to identify you)
      will only be shared if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You give your consent to share that information; or</li>
      <li>The disclosure is allowed or required by law (for example where the concern is raised with a lawyer for the
        purposes of obtaining legal advice); or</li>
      <li>The concern is reported to Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC)</li>
      <li>Where it is necessary to disclose information for the eﬀective investigation of the matter, and this is likely
        to lead to your identiﬁcation, all reasonable steps will be taken to reduce the risk that you will be identiﬁed.
        For example, all personal information or reference to you witnessing an event will be redacted from any report,
        you will be referred to in a gender-neutral context, where possible you will be contacted to help identify
        certain aspects of your disclosure that could inadvertently identify you. Any disclosure under this policy will
        also be handled and investigated by qualiﬁed staﬀ.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The Company will also take the following measures for protecting your identity:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All paper and electronic documents and other materials relating to disclosures will be stored securely;</li>
      <li>Access to all information relating to a disclosure will be limited to those directly involved in managing and
        investigating the disclosure;</li>
      <li>Only a restricted number of people who are directly involved in handling and investigating a disclosure will
        be made aware of your identity (subject to your consent) or information that is likely to lead to your
        identiﬁcation;</li>
      <li>Communications and documents relating to the investigation of a disclosure will not be sent to an email
        address or to a printer that can be accessed by other staﬀ; and</li>
      <li>Each person who is involved in handling and investigating a disclosure will be reminded about the
        conﬁdentiality requirements, including that an unauthorised disclosure of your identity may be a criminal
        oﬀence.</li>
      <li>If you are concerned that your identity has been disclosed in relation to a disclosure, and without your
        consent, you should inform a Whistleblower Protections Oﬃcer or eligible recipient immediately.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Support Available</h2>
    <p>Any employee who makes a disclosure under this policy or is implicated as a result of a disclosure that is made
      may access the Company’s Employee Assistance Program (EAP) which is a free and conﬁdential counselling service on
      Contact Details.</p>
    <p>Where appropriate, the Company may also appoint an independent support person from the Human Resources team to
      deal with any ongoing concerns you may have.</p>
    <p>You may also access third party support providers such as Lifeline (13 11 14) and Beyond Blue (1300 22 4636) for
      support.</p>

    <h2>Other Matters</h2>
    <p>Any breach of this policy will be taken seriously and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including
      termination of employment.</p>
    <p>In so far as this policy imposes any obligations on the Company, those obligations are not contractual and do not
      give rise to any contractual rights. To the extent that this policy describes beneﬁts and entitlements for
      employees, they are discretionary in nature and are also not intended to be contractual. The terms and conditions
      of employment that are intended to be contractual are set out in an employee’s written employment contract.</p>
    <p>The Company may unilaterally introduce, vary, remove or replace this policy at any time.</p>
    <p>Employees are encouraged to read this policy in conjunction with other relevant Company policies, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Code of Conduct</li>
      <li>Grievance Policy</li>
