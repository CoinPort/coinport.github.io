# Cross-Chain Deposits and Refund Policy

CoinPort Pty Ltd, operating as CoinPort, is committed to our customers' security and the integrity of our platform. We understand that in the course of using our services, incorrect deposits, such as sending electronic tokens to a wallet address intended for a different cryptocurrency, can occur. To ensure our users understand the process and their eligibility for a refund, we have created this Cross-chain Deposits and Refund Policy ("Policy").

**Acceptance of the Policy:** By visiting, accessing, or using the CoinPort website, mobile application, or any of our cryptocurrency trading and related services, you confirm that you have read, understood, and accepted the rules outlined in this Policy. If you do not agree with this Policy or any part of it, you must immediately stop using our website, mobile application, and all related services.

Should any conflict arise between the English language version of this Policy and any translation thereof, the English language version will prevail.

If you have any questions about this Policy, please contact us via email at: **  support@coinport.com.au**

### 1. GENERAL PROVISIONS

This Policy applies to any deposit of a CoinPort-supported cryptocurrency or token sent to a blockchain address of another cryptocurrency on a different network. For example, this includes but is not limited to sending Bitcoin (BTC) to a Bitcoin Cash (BCH) address or sending Ethereum (ETH) to an Ethereum Classic (ETC) address.

The User must understand that recovering a cross-chain deposit is a complex, technically demanding, and time-consuming process. **Not all cross-chain deposits are recoverable.** CoinPort will make a reasonable effort to recover funds lost as a result of an incorrect deposit in the shortest time possible.

CoinPort will not attempt to recover unsupported tokens, including tokens from Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), airdrops, or blockchain forks that are not officially supported by the CoinPort platform.

Given the technical complexity and resources required for the recovery process, the User must agree to pay a **Refund Attempt Fee** ("Fee").

-   The Fee is **AUD$1,500** or the cryptocurrency equivalent.
    
-   The Fee is payable in advance and will be deducted from the User's CoinPort wallet.
    
-   The User must understand that paying the Fee **does not guarantee a successful recovery** of the cross-chain deposit. The fee covers the resources expended in the recovery attempt, regardless of the outcome.
    
-   No other fees will be applied for this process.
    

Cross-chain refunds will not be processed for an amount greater than the original deposit.

This Policy does not cover any peer-to-peer transactions between Users and does not refer to any refunds for purchased cryptocurrencies on the CoinPort exchange.

To initiate a refund request, the User must contact the CoinPort Support Service. The User's application must include the following information:

-   The email address associated with the User's CoinPort account.
    
-   The name and ticker of the cryptocurrency that was mistakenly deposited.
    
-   The amount of cryptocurrency.
    
-   The transaction ID (TxID) and a screenshot of the transaction details from the sending wallet or exchange.
    

CoinPort may require additional information about the transaction if necessary. If recovery is deemed possible, the process may require significant technical steps, such as installing or updating wallet software and exporting/importing private keys.

### 2. REFUND ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA

To be eligible for a cross-chain refund attempt, the User must meet all the following criteria:

1.  The User must be a fully verified CoinPort customer who has completed the Know Your Customer (KYC) process.
    
2.  The User must submit a refund application as soon as possible after the cross-chain deposit has occurred.
    
3.  The User must hold an active CoinPort wallet with a sufficient balance to cover the Fee.
    
4.  The total value of the cross-chain deposit must have exceeded **AUD$3,000** (or its cryptocurrency equivalent) at the time of the transaction.
    
5.  The User must have paid the AUD$1,500 Refund Attempt Fee in advance.
    

The cross-chain refund process can only be initiated if all five criteria are met.

### 3. APPLICATION PROCESSING

Upon receiving the User's application, CoinPort will contact the User within a reasonable time to request any further information needed to assess the recovery. The User must respond to CoinPort's request and provide all required information as soon as possible, but no later than 3 business days.

CoinPort will process the application within a reasonable timeframe and will notify the User of the final decision and the outcome of the recovery attempt.

A User's application will be denied in the following cases:

-   The User fails or refuses to provide the necessary information requested by CoinPort.
    
-   CoinPort has reasonable grounds to suspect that the User is, or has been, engaged in fraudulent or any other criminal activity related to the deposit.
    

CoinPort reserves the right to temporarily freeze the User's funds related to the application during the investigation and recovery process.

### 4. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY

CoinPort may modify this Policy from time to time, which will be indicated by changing the "Last updated" date at the bottom of this page. If we make any material changes, the User will be notified by email to the address specified in their account. If a User does not accept the revised Policy, they must stop using the website and our services. Continued use of our services after the date on which changes to this Policy come into effect constitutes agreement with the new rules.
